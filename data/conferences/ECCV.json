		"abstract": "We present a 3D capsule module for processing point clouds that is equivariant to 3D rotations and translations, as well as invariant to permutations of the input points. The operator receives a sparse set of local reference frames, computed from an input point cloud and establishes end-to-end transformation equivariance through a novel dynamic routing procedure on quaternions. Further, we theoretically connect dynamic routing between capsules to the well-known Weiszfeld algorithm, a scheme for solving iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) problems with provable convergence properties. It is shown that such group dynamic routing can be interpreted as robust IRLS rotation averaging on capsule votes, where information is routed based on the final inlier scores. Based on our operator, we build a capsule network that disentangles geometry from pose, paving the way for more informative descriptors and a structured latent space. Our architecture allows joint object classification and orientation estimation without explicit supervision of rotations. We validate our algorithm empirically on common benchmark datasets.",

It comprises of two surrogates, one at the architecture level to improve sample efficiency and one at the weights level, through a supernet, to improve gradient descent training efficiency. On standard benchmark datasets (C10, C100, ImageNet), the resulting models, dubbed NSGANetV2, either match or outperform models from existing approaches with the search being orders of magnitude more sample efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method on six diverse non-standard datasets, e.g. STL-10, Flowers102, Oxford Pets, FGVC Aircrafts etc. In all cases, NSGANetV2s improve the state-of-the-art (under mobile setting), suggesting that NAS can be a viable alternative to conventional transfer learning approaches in handling diverse scenarios such as small-scale or fine-grained datasets.

We find that while these models capture some properties of texture, they fail to capture several compositional properties, such as the colors of dots. We provide critical analysis of existing models by generating synthetic but realistic textures with different descriptions. Our dataset also allows us to train interpretable models and generate language-based explanations of what discriminative features are learned by deep networks for fine-grained categorization where texture plays a key role.

The core of our network is to augment the conditional random fields (CRF), amenable to learning inter-dependency of correlated observations, with the newly devised temporal and spatial self-attention to learn the temporal evolution and spatial relational contexts of every actor in videos. Such a combination utilizes the global receptive fields of self-attention to construct a spatio-temporal graph topology to address the temporal dependency and non-local relationships of the actors. The network first uses the temporal self-attention along with the spatial self-attention, which considers multiple cliques with different scales of locality to account for the diversity of the actors' relationships in group activities, to model the pairwise energy of CRF. Afterward, to accommodate the distinct characteristics of each video, a new mean-field inference algorithm with dynamic halting is also addressed. Finally, a bidirectional universal transformer encoder (UTE), which combines both of the forward and backward temporal context information, is used to aggregate the relational contexts and scene information for group activity recognition. Simulations show that the proposed approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on the widespread Volleyball and Collective Activity datasets.",

We first define an evaluation metric based on a sequence of atomic reasoning operations, enabling quantitative measurement of attention that considers the reasoning process. We then collect human eye-tracking and answer correctness data, and analyze various machine and human attentions on their reasoning capability and how they impact task performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervision method to jointly and progressively optimize attention, reasoning, and task performance so that models learn to look at regions of interests by following a reasoning process.

To overcome this shortcoming, we propose the idea of monocular 6D pose estimation by means of self-supervised learning, removing the need for real annotations. After training our proposed network fully supervised with synthetic RGB data, we leverage recent advances in neural rendering to further self-supervise the model on unannotated real RGB-D data, seeking for a visually and geometrically optimal alignment.

		"title": "Invertible Image Rescaling",
		"abstract": "High-resolution digital images are usually downscaled to fit various display screens or save the cost of storage and bandwidth, meanwhile the post-upscaling is adpoted to recover the original resolutions or the details in the zoom-in images. However, typical image downscaling is a non-injective mapping due to the loss of high-frequency information, which leads to the ill-posed problem of the inverse upscaling procedure and poses great challenges for recovering details from the downscaled low-resolution images. Simply upscaling with image super-resolution methods results in unsatisfactory recovering performance. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by modeling the downscaling and upscaling processes from a new perspective, i.e. an invertible bijective transformation, which can largely mitigate the ill-posed nature of image upscaling. We develop an Invertible Rescaling Net (IRN) with deliberately designed framework and objectives to produce visually-pleasing low-resolution images and meanwhile capture the distribution of the lost information using a latent variable following a specified distribution in the downscaling process. In this way, upscaling is made tractable by inversely passing a randomly-drawn latent variable with the low-resolution image through the network. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of our model over existing methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image upscaling reconstruction from downscaled images.

Recent research addresses some of these concerns for the task of image-based localization by concealing the geometry of the query images and database maps. The core idea of the approach is to lift 2D/3D feature points to random lines, while still providing sufficient constraints for camera pose estimation. In this paper, we further build upon this idea and propose solutions to the different core algorithms of an incremental Structure-from-Motion pipeline based on random line features.

In this paper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions through training with sets of similar images. First, we propose a distinctiveness metric --- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the distinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our metric shows that the human annotations of each image are not equivalent based on distinctiveness. Thus we propose several new training strategies to encourage the distinctiveness of the generated caption for each image, which are based on using CIDErBtw in a weighted loss function or as a reinforcement learning reward. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed approach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw and retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide variety of image captioning baselines.

We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis.

The training only requires examples of positive and negative image pairs and is performed as metric learning of sum-pooled global image descriptors. At inference, the local descriptors are provided by the activations of internal components of the network. We demonstrate why such an approach learns local descriptors that work well for image similarity estimation with classical efficient match kernel methods. The experimental validation studies the trade-off between performance and memory requirements of the state-of-the-art image search approach based on match kernels. Compared to existing local descriptors, the proposed ones perform better in two instance-level recognition tasks and keep memory requirements lower. We experimentally show that global descriptors are not effective enough at large scale and that local descriptors are essential. We achieve state-of-the-art performance, in some cases even with a backbone network as small as ResNet18.",

		"title": "Learn to Recover Visible Color for Video Surveillance in a Day",
		"abstract": "In silicon sensors, the interference between visible and near-infrared (NIR) signals is a crucial problem. For all-day video surveillance, commercial camera systems usually adopt auxiliary NIR cut filter and NIR LED illumination to selectively block or enhance NIR signal according to the surrounding light conditions. This switching between the daytime and the nighttime mode inevitably involves mechanical parts, and thus requires frequent maintenance. Furthermore, images captured at nighttime mode are in shortage of chrominance, which might hinder human interpretation and high-level computer vision algorithms in succession. In this paper, we present a deep learning based approach that directly generates human-friendly, visible color for video surveillance in a day. To enable training, we capture well-aligned video pairs through a customized optical device and contribute a large-scale dataset, video surveillance in a day (VSIAD). We propose a novel multi-task deep network with state synchronization modules to better utilize texture and chrominance information. Our trained model generates high-quality visible color images and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics as well as subjective judgment.",

In contrast, modeling and recovering clothed human and 3D garments remains notoriously difficult, mostly due to the lack of large-scale clothing models available for the research community. We propose to fill this gap by introducing DeepFashion3D, the largest collection to date of 3D garment models, with the goal of establishing a novel benchmark and dataset for the evaluation of image-based garment reconstruction systems. Deep Fashion3D contains 2078 models reconstructed from real garments, which covers 10 different categories and 563 garment instances. It provides rich annotations including 3D feature lines, 3D body pose and the corresponded multi-view real images. In addition, each garment is randomly posed to enhance the variety of real clothing deformations. To demonstrate the advantage of \\datasetName{}, we propose a novel baseline approach for single-view garment reconstruction, which leverages the merits of both mesh and implicit representations. A novel adaptable template is proposed to enable the learning of all types of clothing in a single network. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the proposed dataset to verify its significance and usefulness. We will make Deep Fashion3D publicly available upon publication.",

Towards reducing this superfluous computation, we propose to compute features only at sparsely sampled locations, which are probabilistically chosen according to activation responses, and then densely reconstruct the feature map with an efficient interpolation procedure. With this sampling-interpolation scheme, our network avoids expending computation on spatial locations that can be effectively interpolated, while being robust to activation prediction errors through broadly distributed sampling. A technical challenge of this sampling-based approach is that the binary decision variables for representing discrete sampling locations are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with backpropagation. To circumvent this issue, we make use of a reparameterization trick based on the Gumbel-Softmax distribution, with which backpropagation can iterate these variables towards binary values. The presented network is experimentally shown to save substantial computation while maintaining accuracy over a variety of computer vision tasks.",

Diﬀerent from those previous methods that mostly operate on activations or weights, we present a new optimization technique, namely gradient centralization (GC), which operates directly on gradients by centralizing the gradient vectors to have zero mean. GC can be viewed as a projected gradient descent method with a constrained loss function. We show that GC can regularize both the weight space and output feature space so that it can boost the generalization performance of DNNs. Moreover, GC improves the Lipschitzness of the loss function and its gradient so that the training process becomes more eﬃcient and stable. GC is very simple to implement and can be easily embedded into existing gradient based DNN optimizers with only one line of code. It can also be directly used to ﬁne-tune the pre-trained DNNs. Our experiments on various applications, including general image classiﬁcation, ﬁne-grained image classiﬁcation, detection and segmentation, demonstrate that GC can consistently improve the performance of DNN learning.",

To overcome these problems, in this work we propose an unsupervised deep homography method with a new architecture design. In the spirit of the RANSAC procedure in traditional methods, we specifically learn an outlier mask to only select reliable regions for homography estimation. We calculate loss with respect to our learned deep features instead of directly comparing image content as did previously. To achieve the unsupervised training, we also formulate a novel triplet loss customized for our network.

Specifically, we consider the future hand motion as the motor attention, and model this attention using probabilistic variables in our deep model. The predicted motor attention is further used to select the discriminative spatial-temporal visual features for predicting actions and interaction hotspots.

Training in this manner makes it possible to convert any collection of single RGB images into stereo training data.

Addressing this problem requires novel methods beyond traditional video captioning, as most people would have privacy concerns about deploying cameras throughout their homes. We introduce RF-Diary, a new model for captioning daily life by analyzing the privacy-preserving radio signal in the home with the home's floormap. RF-Diary can further observe and caption people's life through walls and occlusions and in dark settings. In designing RF-Diary, we exploit the ability of radio signals to capture people's 3D dynamics, and use the floormap to help the model learn people's interactions with objects. We also use a multi-modal feature alignment training scheme that leverages existing video-based captioning datasets to improve the performance of our radio-based captioning model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RF-Diary generates accurate captions under visible conditions. It also sustains its good performance in dark or occluded settings, where video-based captioning approaches fail to generate meaningful captions.",

		"title": "Self-Challenging Improves Cross-Domain Generalization",
		"abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) conduct image classification by activating dominant features that correlated with labels. When the training and testing data are under similar distributions, their dominant features are similar, leading to decent test performance. The performance is nonetheless unmet when tested with different distributions, leading to the challenges in cross-domain image classification. We introduce a simple training heuristic, Representation Self-Challenging (RSC), that significantly improves the generalization of CNN to the out-of-domain data. RSC iteratively challenges (discards) the dominant features activated on the training data, and forces the network to activate remaining features that correlate with labels. This process appears to activate feature representations applicable to out-of-domain data without prior knowledge of the new domain and without learning extra network parameters. We present the theoretical properties and conditions of RSC for improving cross-domain generalization. The experiments endorse the simple, effective, and architecture-agnostic nature of our RSC method.",

The mIRT effectively estimates the concept difficulty and the model competence at each learning step from accumulated model responses. The estimated concept difficulty and model competence are further utilized to select the most profitable training samples. Experimental results on CLEVR show that with a competence-aware curriculum, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances with superior data efficiency and convergence speed.

		"abstract": "Recently, dynamic inference has emerged as a promising way to reduce the computational cost of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In contrast to static methods (e.g., weight pruning), dynamic inference adaptively adjusts the inference process according to each input sample, which can considerably reduce the computational cost on \"\"easy\"\" samples while maintaining the overall model performance. In this paper, we introduce a general framework, S2DNAS, which can transform various static CNN models to support dynamic inference via neural architecture search. To this end, based on a given CNN model, we first generate a CNN architecture space in which each architecture is a multi-stage CNN generated from the given model using some predefined transformations. Then, we propose a reinforcement learning based approach to automatically search for the optimal CNN architecture in the generated space. At last, with the searched multi-stage network, we can perform dynamic inference by adaptively choosing a stage to evaluate for each sample. Unlike previous works that introduce irregular computations or complex controllers in the inference or re-design a CNN model from scratch, our method can generalize to most of the popular CNN architectures and the searched dynamic network can be directly deployed using existing deep learning frameworks in various hardware devices.",

In this work, we propose a new framework called Resolution-adaptive Flow Coding (RaFC) to effectively compress the flow maps globally and locally, in which we use multi-resolution representations instead of single-resolution representations for both the input flow maps and the output motion features of the MV encoder. To handle complex or simple motion patterns globally, our frame-level scheme RaFC-frame automatically decides the optimal flow map resolution for each video frame. To cope different types of motion patterns locally, our block-level scheme called RaFC-block can also select the optimal resolution for each local block of motion features. In addition, the rate-distortion criterion is applied to both RaFC-frame and RaFC-block and select the optimal motion coding mode for effective flow coding. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets HEVC, VTL, UVG and MCL-JCV clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our overall RaFC framework after combing RaFC-frame and RaFC-block for video compression.",

While multi-view videos are not common, the videos of a celebrity performing a specific action are usually abundant on the Internet. Even if these videos were recorded at different time instances, they would encode the same motion characteristics of the person. Therefore, we propose to capture human motion by jointly analyzing these Internet videos instead of using single videos separately. However, this new task poses many new challenges that cannot be addressed by existing methods, as the videos are unsynchronized, the camera viewpoints are unknown, the background scenes are different, and the human motions are not exactly the same among videos. To address these challenges, we propose a novel optimization-based framework and experimentally demonstrate its ability to recover much more precise and detailed motion from multiple videos, compared against monocular motion capture methods.",

With APM aligning the adjacent feature maps in pixel level, the following 3D convolution can model temporal information on the premise of maintaining the appearance representation quality.

Fortunately it is a coupled problem: the pose can be found easily given the correspondences and vice versa. Existing approaches assume that noisy correspondences are provided, that a good pose prior is available, or that the problem size is small. We instead propose the first fully end-to-end trainable network for solving the blind PnP problem efficiently and globally, that is, without the need for pose priors. We make use of recent results in differentiating optimization problems to incorporate geometric model fitting into an end-to-end learning framework, including Sinkhorn, RANSAC and PnP algorithms.

		"title": "Exploiting Deep Generative Prior for Versatile Image Restoration and Manipulation",
		"abstract": "Learning a good image prior is a long-term goal for image restoration and manipulation. While existing methods like deep image prior (DIP) capture low-level image statistics, there are still gaps toward an image prior that captures rich image semantics including color, spatial coherence, textures, and high-level concepts. This work presents an effective way to exploit the image prior captured by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on large-scale natural images. As shown in Fig.1, the deep generative prior (DGP) provides compelling results to restore missing semantics, e.g., color, patch, resolution, of various degraded images. It also enables diverse image manipulation including random jittering, image morphing, and category transfer. Such highly flexible effects are made possible through relaxing the assumption of existing GAN-inversion methods, which tend to fix the generator. Notably, we allow the generator to be fine-tuned on-the-fly in a progressive manner regularized by feature distance obtained by the discriminator in GAN. We show that these easy-to-implement and practical changes help preserve the reconstruction to remain in the manifold of nature image, and thus lead to more precise and faithful reconstruction for real images.

The bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms, resulting in rather limited reconstruction quality. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework for the reconstruction of high-quality LFs from acquisitions via learned coded apertures. The proposed method incorporates the measurement observation into the deep learning framework elegantly to avoid relying entirely on data-driven priors for LF reconstruction. Specifically, we first formulate the compressive LF reconstruction as an inverse problem with an implicit regularization term. Then, we construct the regularization term with an efficient deep spatial-angular convolutional sub-network to comprehensively explore the signal distribution free from the limited representation ability and inefficiency of deterministic mathematical modeling. Experimental results show that the reconstructed LFs not only achieve much higher PSNR/SSIM but also preserve the LF parallax structure better, compared with state-of-the-art methods on both real and synthetic LF benchmarks. In addition, experiments show that our method is efficient and robust to noise, which is an essential advantage for a real camera system.

Since the amplitude of the physiological signals is usually very small, they can be easily affected by head movements, lighting conditions, and sensor diversities. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-verified feature disentangling strategy to disentangle the physiological features with non-physiological representations such as head movements and lighting conditions, and then use the distilled physiological features for robust multi-task physiological measurements. We first transform the input face videos into a multi-scale spatial-temporal map (MSTmap), which can suppress the irrelevant background and noise features while retaining most of the temporal characteristics of the periodic physiological signals. Then we take pairwise MSTmaps as inputs to an autoencoder architecture with two encoders (one for physiological signals and the other for non-physiological information) and use a cross-verified scheme to obtain physiological features disentangled with the non-physiological features. The disentangled features are finally used for the joint prediction of multiple physiological signals like average HR values and rPPG signals. Comprehensive experiments on different large-scale public datasets of multiple physiological measurement tasks as well as the cross-database testing demonstrate the robustness of our approach.",

However, they can only produce static surfaces that are not controllable, which provides limited ability to modify the resulting model by editing its pose or shape parameters.

We subsequently use correspondences to fit the body model to our inner surface and then non-rigidly deform it (under a parametric body + displacement model) to the outer surface in order to capture garment, face and hair detail. In quantitative and qualitative experiments with both full body data and hand scans we show that the proposed methodology generalizes, and is effective even given incomplete point clouds collected from single-view depth images.

		"title": "Mining Cross-Image Semantics for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation",
		"abstract": "This paper studies the problem of learning semantic segmentation from image-level supervision only. Current popular solutions leverage object localization maps from classifiers as supervision signals, and struggle to make the localization maps capture more complete object content. Rather than previous efforts that primarily focus on intra-image information, we address the value of cross-image semantic relations for comprehensive object pattern mining. To achieve this, two neural co-attentions are incorporated into the classifier to complimentarily capture cross-image semantic similarities and differences. In particular, given a pair of training images, one co-attention enforces the classifier to recognize the common semantics from co-attentive objects, while the other one, called contrastive co-attention, drives the classifier to identify the unshared semantics from the rest, uncommon objects. This helps the classifier discover more object patterns and better ground semantics in image regions. In addition to boosting object pattern learning, the co-attention can leverage context from other related images to improve localization map inference, hence eventually benefiting semantic segmentation learning. More essentially, our algorithm provides a unified framework that handles well different WSSS settings, i.e., learning WSSS with (1) precise image-level supervision only, (2) extra simple single-label data, and (3) extra noisy web data. It sets new state-of-the-arts on all these settings, demonstrating well its efficacy and generalizability.",

The responsiveness of the agent is largely governed by latency of its processing pipeline. While past work has studied the algorithmic trade-off between latency and accuracy, there has not been a clear metric to compare different methods along the Pareto optimal latency-accuracy curve. We point out a discrepancy between standard offline evaluation and real-time applications: by the time an algorithm finishes processing a particular image frame, the surrounding world has changed. To these ends, we present an approach that coherently integrates latency and accuracy into a single metric for real-time online perception, which we refer to as \"\"streaming accuracy\"\". The key insight behind this metric is to jointly evaluate the output of the entire perception stack at every time instant, forcing the stack to consider the amount of streaming data that should be ignored while computation is occurring. More broadly, building upon this metric, we introduce a meta-benchmark that systematically converts any image understanding task into a streaming perception task. We focus on the illustrative tasks of object detection and instance segmentation in urban video streams, and contribute a novel dataset with high-quality and temporally-dense annotations. Our proposed solutions and their empirical analysis demonstrate a number of surprising conclusions: (1) there exists an optimal \"\"sweet spot\"\" that maximizes streaming accuracy along the Pareto optimal latency-accuracy curve, (2) asynchronous tracking and future forecasting naturally emerge as internal representations that enable streaming image understanding, and (3) dynamic scheduling can be used to overcome temporal aliasing, yielding the paradoxical result that latency is sometimes minimized by sitting idle and \"\"doing nothing\"\".",

		"abstract": "We discuss a general formulation for the Continual Learning (CL) problem for classification---a learning task where a stream provides samples to a learner and the goal of the learner, depending on the samples it receives, is to continually upgrade its knowledge about the old classes and learn new ones. Our formulation takes inspiration from the open-set recognition problem where test scenarios do not necessarily belong to the training distribution. We also discuss various quirks and assumptions encoded in recently proposed approaches for CL. We argue that some oversimplify the problem to an extent that leaves it with very little practical importance, and makes it extremely easy to perform well on. To validate this, we propose GDumb that (1) greedily stores samples in memory as they come and; (2) at test time, trains a model from scratch using samples only in the memory. We show that even though GDumb is not specifically designed for CL problems, it obtains state-of-the-art accuracies (often with large margins) in almost all the experiments when compared to a multitude of recently proposed algorithms. Surprisingly, it outperforms approaches in CL formulations for which they were specifically designed. This, we believe, raises concerns regarding our progress in CL for classification. Overall, we hope our formulation, characterizations and discussions will help in designing realistically useful CL algorithms, and GDumb will serve as a strong contender for the same.",

Instead of encoding vectorized maps as raster images, we construct a lane graph from raw map data to explicitly preserve the map structure. To capture the complex topology and long range dependencies of the lane graph, we propose LaneGCN which extends graph convolutions with multiple adjacency matrices and along-lane dilation. To capture the complex interactions between actors and maps, we exploit a fusion network consisting of four types of interactions, actor-to-lane, lane-to-lane, lane-to-actor and actor-to-actor. Powered by LaneGCN and actor-map interactions, our model is able to predict accurate and realistic multi-modal trajectories. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the large scale Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark.",

Our method infers regular facade details from satellite-based image-fragments of a building, and applies them to occluded or under-sampled parts of the building, resulting in plausible, crisp facades.

		"abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in a range of tasks. However, CNNs are often viewed as \"\"black-box\"\" and lack of interpretability. One main reason is due to the filter-class entanglement -- an intricate many-to-many correspondence between filters and classes. Most existing works attempt post-hoc interpretation on a pre-trained model, while neglecting to reduce the entanglement underlying the model. In contrast, we focus on alleviating filter-class entanglement during training. Inspired by cellular differentiation, we propose a novel strategy to train interpretable CNNs by encouraging class-specific filters, among which each filter responds to only one (or few) class. Concretely, we design a learnable sparse Class-Specific Gate (CSG) structure to assign each filter with one (or few) class in a flexible way. The gate allows a filter's activation to pass only when the input samples come from the specific class. Extensive experiments demonstrate the fabulous performance of our method in generating a sparse and highly class-related representation of the input, which leads to stronger interpretability. Moreover, comparing with the standard training strategy, our model displays benefits in applications like object localization and adversarial sample detection.

This strong correlation allows us to fast spot the pruned candidates with highest potential accuracy without actually fine-tuning them. This module is also general to plug-in and improve some existing pruning algorithms. EagleEye achieves better pruning performance than all of the studied pruning algorithms in our experiments. Concretely, to prune MobileNet V1 and ResNet-50, EagleEye outperforms all compared methods by up to 3.8%.

We mitigate this by descending the deep layers of a pre-trained network, where the deep features contain more semantics, and applying the translation between these deep features. Our translation is performed in a cascaded, deep-to-shallow, fashion, along the deep feature hierarchy: we first translate between the deepest layers that encode the higher-level semantic content of the image, proceeding to translate the shallower layers, conditioned on the deeper ones.

Our framework consists in a joint learning of multiple local descriptors with different levels of invariance and of meta descriptors encoding the regional variations of an image. The similarity of these meta descriptors across images is used to select the right invariance when matching the local descriptors. Our approach, named Local Invariance Selection at Runtime for Descriptors (LISRD), enables descriptors to adapt to adverse changes in images, while remaining discriminative when invariance is not required.

		"abstract": "Deep encoder-decoder based CNNs have advanced image inpainting methods for hole filling. While existing methods recover structures and textures step-by-step in the hole regions, they typically use two encoder-decoders for separate recovery. The CNN features of each encoder are learned to capture either missing structures or textures without considering them as a whole. The insufficient utilization of these encoder features hampers the performance of recovering both structures and textures. In this paper, we propose a mutual encoder-decoder CNN for joint recovery of both. We use CNN features from the deep and shallow layers of the encoder to represent structures and textures of an input image, respectively. The deep layer features are sent to a structure branch, while the shallow layer features are sent to a texture branch. In each branch, we fill holes in multiple scales of the CNN features. The filled CNN features from both branches are concatenated and then equalized. During feature equalization, we reweigh channel attentions first and propose a bilateral propagation activation function to enable spatial equalization. To this end, the filled CNN features of structure and texture mutually benefit each other to represent image content at all feature levels. We then use the equalized feature to supplement decoder features for output image generation through skip connections. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method is effective to recover structures and textures and performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.",

Key to our construction is the introduction of a geometric distortion criterion, defined directly on the decoded shapes, translating the preservation of the metric on the decoding to the formation of linear paths in the underlying latent space. Our rationale lies in the observation that training samples alone are often insufficient to endow generative models with high fidelity, motivating the need for large training datasets. In contrast, metric preservation provides a rigorous way to control the amount of geometric distortion incurring in the construction of the latent space, leading in turn to synthetic samples of higher quality. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the adoption of differentiable intrinsic distances in the backpropagation of a geodesic loss. Our geometric priors are particularly relevant in the presence of scarce training data, where learning any meaningful latent structure can be especially challenging. The effectiveness and potential of our generative model is showcased in applications of style transfer and content generation using triangle meshes and point clouds.",

To alleviate it, we design a novel facial age prior to guide the aging mechanism modeling. To explore the age effects on facial images, we propose a Disentangled Adversarial Autoencoder (DAAE) to disentangle the facial images into three independent factors: age, identity and extraneous information. To avoid the \"\"wash away\"\" of age and identity information in face aging process, we propose a hierarchical conditional generator by passing the disentangled identity and age embeddings to the high-level and low-level layers with class-conditional BatchNorm. Finally, a disentangled adversarial learning mechanism is introduced to boost the image quality for face aging. In this way, when manipulating the age distribution, DAAE can achieve face aging with arbitrary ages. Further, given an input face image, the mean value of the learned age posterior distribution can be treated as an age estimator. These indicate that DAAE can efficiently and accurately estimate the age distribution by a disentangling manner. DAAE is the first attempt to achieve facial age analysis tasks, including face aging with arbitrary ages, exemplar-based face aging and age estimation, in an universal framework.

However, such discriminative representation focuses only on known classes, which may not be critical for distinguishing the unknown classes. We argue that the representation space should be jointly learned from the inlier classifier and the density estimator (served as an outlier detector). We propose the OpenHybrid framework, which is composed of an encoder to encode the input data into a joint embedding space, a classifier to classify samples to inlier classes, and a flow-based density estimator to detect whether a sample belongs to the unknown category. A typical problem of existing flow-based models is that they may assign a higher likelihood to outliers.

Nevertheless, most practical methods still require all training videos to be labeled with temporal annotations (action category and temporal boundary) and develop the models in a fully-supervised manner, despite expensive labeling efforts and inapplicable to new categories. In this paper, we introduce a new design of transfer learning type to learn action localization for a large set of action categories, but only on action moments from the categories of interest and temporal annotations of untrimmed videos from a small set of action classes. Specifically, we present Action Herald Networks (AherNet) that integrate such design into an one-stage action localization framework. Technically, a weight transfer function is uniquely devised to build the transformation between classification of action moments or foreground video segments and action localization in synthetic contextual moments or untrimmed videos. The context of each moment is learnt through the adversarial mechanism to differentiate the generated features from those of background in untrimmed videos. Extensive experiments are conducted on the learning both across the splits of ActivityNet v1.3 and from THUMOS14 to ActivityNet v1.3. Our AherNet demonstrates the superiority even comparing to most fully-supervised action localization methods.

		"abstract": "Retrieving content relevant images from a large-scale fine-grained dataset could suffer from intolerably slow query speed and highly redundant storage cost, due to high-dimensional real-valued embeddings which aim to distinguish subtle visual differences of fine-grained objects. In this paper, we study the novel fine-grained hashing topic to generate compact binary codes for fine-grained images, leveraging the search and storage efficiency of hash learning to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Specifically, we propose a unified end-to-end trainable network, termed as ExchNet. Based on attention mechanisms and proposed attention constraints, it can firstly obtain both local and global features to represent object parts and whole fine-grained objects, respectively. Furthermore, to ensure the discriminative ability and semantic meaning's consistency of these part-level features across images, we design a local feature alignment approach by performing a feature exchanging operation. Later, an alternative learning algorithm is employed to optimize the whole ExchNet and then generate the final binary hash codes. Validated by extensive experiments, our ExchNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generic hashing methods on five fine-grained datasets, which shows our effectiveness. Moreover, compared with other approximate nearest neighbor methods, ExchNet achieves the best speed-up and storage reduction, revealing its efficiency and practicality.",

In this paper, we attempt to address the lack of a global perspective of the top-down approaches by introducing a novel form of supervision - Hierarchical Multi-person Ordinal Relations (HMOR). The HMOR encodes interaction information as the ordinal relations of depths and angles hierarchically, which captures the body-part and joint level semantic and maintains global consistency at the same time. In our approach, an integrated top-down model is designed to leverage these ordinal relations in the learning process. The integrated model estimates human bounding boxes, human depths, and root-relative 3D poses simultaneously, with a coarse-to-fine architecture to improve the accuracy of depth estimation.

		"title": "PhraseClick: Toward Achieving Flexible Interactive Segmentation by Phrase and Click",
		"abstract": "Existing interactive object segmentation methods mainly take spatial interactions such as bounding boxes or clicks as input. However, these interactions do not contain information about explicit attributes of the target-of-interest and thus cannot quickly specify what the selected object exactly is, especially when there are diverse scales of candidate objects or the target-of-interest contains multiple objects. Therefore, excessive user interactions are often required to reach desirable results. On the other hand, in existing approaches attribute information of objects is often not well utilized in interactive segmentation. We propose to employ phrase expressions as another interaction input to infer the attributes of target object. In this way, we can 1) leverage spatial clicks to locate the target object and 2) utilize semantic phrases to qualify the attributes of the target object. Specifically, the phrase expressions focus on ``what\"\" the target object is and the spatial clicks are in charge of ``where\"\" the target object is, which together help to accurately segment the target-of-interest with smaller number of interactions. Moreover, the proposed approach is flexible in terms of interaction modes and can efficiently handle complex scenarios by leveraging the strengths of each type of input. Our multi-modal phrase+click approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance on interactive segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage both clicks and phrases for interactive segmentation.",

Most successful 3D detectors take the projection constraint from the 3D bounding box to the 2D box as an important component. Four edges of a 2D box provide only four constraints and the performance deteriorates dramatically with the small error of the 2D detector. Different from these approaches, our method predicts the nine perspective keypoints of a 3D bounding box in image space, and then utilize the geometric relationship of 3D and 2D perspectives to recover the dimension, location, and orientation in 3D space. In this method, the properties of the object can be predicted stably even when the estimation of keypoints is very noisy, which enables us to obtain fast detection speed with a small architecture. Training our method only uses the 3D properties of the object without any extra annotations, category-specific 3D shape priors, or depth maps. Our method is the first real-time system (FPS>24) for monocular image 3D detection while achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.",

		"abstract": "How to make a segmentation model efficiently adapt to a specific video as well as online target appearance variations is a fun- damental issue in the field of video object segmentation. In this work, a graph memory network is developed to address the novel idea of “learning to update the segmentation model”. Specifically, we exploit an episodic memory network, organized as a fully connected graph, to store frames as nodes and capture cross-frame correlations by edges. Further, learnable controllers are embedded to ease memory reading and writing, as well as maintain a fixed memory scale. The structured, external memory design enables our model to comprehensively mine and quickly store new knowl- edge, even with limited visual information, and the differentiable memory controllers slowly learn an abstract method for storing useful represen- tations in the memory and how to later use these representations for prediction, via gradient descent. In addition, the proposed graph mem- ory network yields a neat yet principled framework, which can generalize well to both one-shot and zero-shot video object segmentation tasks. Ex- tensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets verify that our graph memory network is able to facilitate the adaptation of the segmentation network for case-by-case video object segmentation.",

		"title": "Rethinking Bottleneck Structure for Efficient Mobile Network Design",
		"abstract": "The inverted residual block is dominating architecture design for mobile networks recently. It changes the classic residual bottleneck by introducing two design rules: learning inverted residuals and using linear bottlenecks. In this paper, we rethink the necessity of such design change and find it may bring risks of information loss and gradient confusion. We thus propose to flip the structure and present a novel bottleneck design, called sandglass block, that performs identity mapping and spatial transformation at higher dimensions and thus alleviates information loss and gradient confusion effectively. Extensively experiments demonstrate that, different from the common belief, such bottleneck structure is indeed more beneficial than the inverted ones for mobile networks. In ImageNet classification, by simply replacing the inverted residual block with sandglass block, without increasing parameters and computations, the classification accuracy can be improved by more than 1.7% over MobileNetV2. On Pascal VOC 2007 test set, we observe that there is also 0.9% mAP improvement in object detection. We further verify the effectiveness of sandglass block by adding it into the search space of neural architecture search method DARTS. With 25% parameter reduction, the classification accuracy is improved by 0.13% over previous DARTS models. Code will be made publicly available.",

		"title": "Side-Tuning: A Baseline for Network Adaptation via Additive Side Networks",
		"abstract": "When training a neural network for a desired task, one may prefer to adapt a pre-trained network rather than starting from randomly initialized weights. Adaptation can be useful in cases when training data is scarce, when a single learner needs to perform multiple tasks, or when one wishes to encode priors in the network. The most commonly employed approaches for network adaptation are fine-tuning and using the pre-trained network as a fixed feature extractor, among others.  In this paper, we propose a straightforward alternative: side-tuning. Side-tuning adapts a pre-trained network by training a lightweight \"\"side\"\" network that is fused with the (unchanged) pre-trained network via summation. This simple method works as well as or better than existing solutions and it resolves some of the basic issues with fine-tuning, fixed features, and other common approaches. In particular, side-tuning is less prone to overfitting, is asymptotically consistent, and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning. We demonstrate the performance of side-tuning under a diverse set of scenarios, including incremental learning (iCIFAR, iTaskonomy), reinforcement learning, imitation learning (visual navigation in Habitat), NLP question-answering (SQuAD v2), and single-task transfer learning (Taskonomy), with consistently promising results.",

Similar to other deep models, state-of-the-art GANs also suffer from high parameter complexities. That has recently motivated the exploration of compressing GANs (usually generators). Compared to the vast literature and prevailing success in compressing deep classifiers, the study of GAN compression remains in its infancy, so far leveraging individual compression techniques instead of more sophisticated combinations. We observe that due to the notorious instability of training GANs, heuristically stacking different compression techniques will result in unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose the first end-to-end optimization framework combining multiple compression means for GAN compression, dubbed GAN Slimming (GS). GS seamlessly integrates three mainstream compression techniques: model distillation, channel pruning and quantization, together with the GAN minimax objective, into one unified optimization form, that can be efficiently optimized from end to end.

Most notably, the observable surface of the 3D point clouds is disjoint from the center of the instance to ground the bounding box prediction on. To this end, we propose Generative Sparse Detection Network (GSDN), a fully-convolutional single-shot sparse detection network that efficiently generates the support for object proposals. The key component of our model is a generative sparse tensor decoder, which uses a series of transposed convolutions and pruning layers to expand the support of sparse tensors while discarding unlikely object centers to maintain minimal runtime and memory footprint. GSDN can process unprecedentedly large-scale inputs with a single fully-convolutional feed-forward pass, thus does not require the heuristic post-processing stage that stitches results from sliding windows as other previous methods have. We validate our approach on three 3D indoor datasets including the large-scale 3D indoor reconstruction dataset where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a relative improvement of 7.14% while being 3.78 times faster than the best prior work.",

		"title": "Grounded Situation Recognition",
		"abstract": "We introduce Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR), a task that requires producing structured semantic summaries of images describing: the primary activity, entities engaged in the activity with their roles (e.g. agent, tool), and bounding-box groundings of entities. GSR presents important technical challenges: identifying semantic saliency, categorizing and localizing a large and diverse set of entities, overcoming semantic sparsity, and disambiguating roles. Moreover, unlike in captioning, GSR is straightforward to evaluate. To study this new task we create the Situations With Groundings (SWiG) dataset which adds 278,336 bounding-box groundings to the 11,538 entity classes in the imsitu dataset. We propose a Joint Situation Localizer and find that jointly predicting situations and groundings with end-to-end training handily outperforms independent training with late fusion on the entire grounding metric suite with relative gains between 8% and 32%. Finally, we show initial findings on three exciting future directions enabled by our models: conditional querying, visual chaining, and grounded semantic aware image retrieval.

		"abstract": "Automatically generating sentences to describe events and temporally localizing sentences in a video are two important tasks that bridge language and videos. Recent techniques leverage the multimodal nature of videos by using off-the-shelf features to represent videos, but interactions between modalities are rarely explored. Inspired by the fact that there exist cross-modal interactions in the human brain, we propose a novel method for learning pairwise modality interactions in order to better exploit complementary information for each pair of modalities in videos and thus improve performances on both tasks. We model modality interaction in both the sequence and channel levels in a pairwise fashion, and the pairwise interaction also provides some explainability for the predictions of target tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and validate specific design choices through extensive ablation studies. Our method turns out to achieve state-of-the-art performances on four standard benchmark datasets: MSVD and MSR-VTT (event captioning task), and Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions (temporal sentence localization task).",

		"title": "Unpaired Learning of Deep Image Denoising",
		"abstract": "We investigate the task of learning blind image denoising networks from an unpaired set of clean and noisy images. Such problem setting generally is practical and valuable considering that it is feasible to collect unpaired noisy and clean images in most real-world applications. And we further assume that the noise can be signal dependent but is spatially uncorrelated. In order to facilitate unpaired learning of denoising network, this paper presents a two-stage scheme by incorporating self-supervised learning and knowledge distillation. For self-supervised learning, we suggest a dilated blind-spot network (D-BSN) to learn denoising solely from real noisy images. Due to the spatial independence of noise, we adopt a network by stacking $1 imes1$ convolution layers to estimate the noise level map for each image. Both the D-BSN and image-specific noise model ($ ext{CNN}_{ ext{est}}$) can be jointly trained via maximizing the constrained log-likelihood. Given the output of D-BSN and estimated noise level map, improved denoising performance can be further obtained based on the Bayes' rule. As for knowledge distillation, we first apply the learned noise models to clean images to synthesize a paired set of training images, and use the real noisy images and the corresponding denoising results in the first stage to form another paired set. Then, the ultimate denoising model can be distilled by training an existing denoising network using these two paired sets. Experiments show that our unpaired learning method performs favorably on both synthetic noisy images and real-world noisy photographs in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation.

		"abstract": "The task of large-scale retrieval-based image localization is to estimate the geographical location of a query image by recognizing its nearest reference images from a city-scale dataset. However, the general public benchmarks only provide noisy GPS labels associated with the training images, which act as weak supervisions for learning image-to-image similarities. Such label noise prevents deep neural networks from learning discriminative features for accurate localization. To tackle this challenge, we propose to self-supervise image-to-region similarities in order to fully explore the potential of difficult positive images alongside their sub-regions. The estimated image-to-region similarities can serve as extra training supervision for improving the network in generations, which could in turn gradually refine the fine-grained similarities to achieve optimal performance. Our proposed self-enhanced image-to-region similarity labels effectively deal with the training bottleneck in the state-of-the-art pipelines without any additional parameters or manual annotations in both training and inference. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on the standard localization benchmarks by noticeable margins and shows excellent generalization capability on multiple image retrieval datasets.",

		"abstract": "Novel view video synthesis aims to synthesize novel viewpoints videos given input captures of a human performance taken from multiple reference viewpoints and over consecutive time steps. Despite great advances in model-free novel view synthesis, existing methods present three limitations when applied to complex and time-varying human performance. First, these methods (and related datasets) mainly consider simple and symmetric objects. Second, they do not enforce explicit consistency across generated views. Third, they focus on static and non-moving objects. The fine-grained details of a human subject can therefore suffer from inconsistencies when synthesized across different viewpoints or time steps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a human-specific framework that employs a learned 3D-aware representation. Specifically, we first introduce a novel siamese network that employs a gating layer for better reconstruction of the latent volumetric representation and, consequently, final visual results. Moreover, features from consecutive time steps are shared inside the network to improve temporal consistency. Second, we introduce a novel loss to explicitly enforce consistency across generated views both in space and in time. Third, we present the Multi-View Human Action (MVHA) dataset, consisting of near 1200 synthetic human performance captured from 54 viewpoints. Experiments on the MVHA, Pose-Varying Human Model and ShapeNet datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines both in view generation quality and spatio-temporal consistency.",

		"title": "Side-Aware Boundary Localization for More Precise Object Detection",
		"abstract": "Current object detection frameworks mainly rely on bounding box regression to localize objects. Despite the remarkable progress in recent years, the precision of bounding box regression remains unsatisfactory, hence limiting performance in object detection. We observe that precise localization requires careful placement of each side of the bounding box. However, the mainstream approach, which focuses on predicting centers and sizes, is not the most effective way to accomplish this task, especially when there exists displacements with large variance between the anchors and the targets. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, named as Side-Aware Boundary Localization (SABL), where each side of the bounding box is respectively localized with a dedicated network branch. To tackle the difficulty of precise localization in the presence of displacements with large variance, we further propose a two-step localization scheme, which first predicts a range of movement through bucket prediction and then pinpoints the precise position within the predicted bucket. We test the proposed method on both two-stage and single-stage detection frameworks. Replacing the standard bounding box regression branch with the proposed design leads to significant improvements on Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and Cascade R-CNN, by 3.0%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively.

		"abstract": "In this paper, we study an intermediate form of supervision, i.e., single-frame supervision, for temporal action localization (TAL). To obtain the single-frame supervision, the annotators are asked to identify only a single frame within the temporal window of an action. This can significantly reduce the labor cost of obtaining full supervision which requires annotating the action boundary. Compared to the weak supervision that only annotates the video-level label, the single-frame supervision introduces extra temporal action signals while maintaining low annotation overhead. To make full use of such single-frame supervision, we propose a unified system called SF-Net. First, we propose to predict an actionness score for each video frame. Along with a typical category score, the actionness score can provide comprehensive information about the occurrence of a potential action and aid the temporal boundary refinement during inference. Second, we mine pseudo action and background frames based on the single-frame annotations. We identify pseudo action frames by adaptively expanding each annotated single frame to its nearby, contextual frames and we mine pseudo background frames from all the unannotated frames across multiple videos. Together with the ground-truth labeled frames, these pseudo-labeled frames are further used for training the classifier.",

To this end, we design a Siamese network that jointly learns 3D local feature detection and description directly from raw 3D points. It integrates FlexConv and Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) to assure that the learned local descriptor captures multi-level geometric information and channel-wise relations. For detecting 3D keypoints we predict the discriminativeness of the local descriptors in an unsupervised manner. We generate the global descriptor by directly aggregating the learned local descriptors with an effective attention mechanism. In this way, local and global 3D descriptors are inferred in one single forward pass. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results for both global point cloud retrieval and local point cloud registration in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. To validate the generalizability and robustness of our 3D keypoints, we demonstrate that our method also performs favorably without fine-tuning on the registration of point clouds that were generated by a visual SLAM system.

		"title": "Face Super-Resolution Guided by 3D Facial Priors",
		"abstract": "State-of-the-art face super-resolution methods employ deep convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping between low- and high-resolution facial patterns by exploring local appearance knowledge. However, most of these methods do not well exploit facial structures and identity information, and struggle to deal with facial images that exhibit large pose variations. In this paper, we propose a novel face super-resolution method that explicitly incorporates 3D facial priors which grasp the sharp facial structures. Our work is the first to explore 3D morphable knowledge based on the fusion of parametric descriptions of face attributes (e.g., identity, facial expression, texture, illumination, and face pose). Furthermore, the priors can easily be incorporated into any networks and are extremely efficient in improving the performance and accelerating the convergence speed. Firstly, a 3D face rendering branch is set up to obtain 3D priors of salient facial structures and identity knowledge. Secondly, the Spatial Attention Module is used to better exploit this hierarchical information (i.e., intensity similarity, 3D facial structure, and identity content) for the super-resolution problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D priors achieve superior face super-resolution results over the state-of-the-arts.",

		"abstract": "Motivated by the problem relatedness between unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL), many state-of-the-art UDA methods adopt SSL principles (e.g., the cluster assumption) as their learning ingredients. However, they tend to overlook the very domain-shift nature of UDA. In this work, we take a step further to study the proper extensions of SSL techniques for UDA. Taking the algorithm of label propagation (LP) as an example, we analyze the challenges of adopting LP to UDA and theoretically analyze the conditions of affinity graph/matrix construction in order to achieve better propagation of true labels to unlabeled instances. Our analysis suggests a new algorithm of Label Propagation with Augmented Anchors (A$^2$LP), which could potentially improve LP via generation of unlabeled virtual instances (i.e., the augmented anchors) with high-confidence label predictions. To make the proposed A$^2$LP useful for UDA, we propose empirical schemes to generate such virtual instances. The proposed schemes also tackle the domain-shift challenge of UDA by alternating between pseudo labeling via A$^2$LP and domain-invariant feature learning. Experiments show that such a simple SSL extension improves over representative UDA methods of domain-invariant feature learning, and could empower two state-of-the-art methods on benchmark UDA datasets. Our results show the value of further investigation on SSL techniques for UDA problems.",

In this paper, we ask the question: can we find high-quality neural architectures using only images, but no human-annotated labels? To answer this question, we first define a new setup called Unsupervised Neural Architecture Search (UnNAS). We then conduct two sets of experiments. In sample-based experiments, we train a large number (500) of diverse architectures with either supervised or unsupervised objectives, and found that the architecture rankings produced with and without labels are highly correlated. In search-based experiments, we run a well-established NAS algorithm (DARTS) using various unsupervised objectives, and report that the architectures searched without labels can be competitive to their counterparts searched with labels. Together, these results reveal the potentially surprising finding that labels are not necessary, and the image statistics alone may be sufficient to identify good neural architectures.",

We propose two associative alignment strategies: 1) a metric-learning loss for minimizing the distance between related base samples and the centroid of novel instances in the feature space, and 2) a conditional adversarial alignment loss based on the Wasserstein distance. Experiments on four standard datasets and three backbones demonstrate that combining our centroid-based alignment loss results in absolute accuracy improvements of 4.4%, 1.2%, and 6.2% in 5-shot learning over the state of the art for object recognition, fine-grained classification, and cross-domain adaptation, respectively.",

Since 2D poses are projected from 3D space, they have an inherent ambiguity, which is difficult to represent through a deterministic mapping. Hence, we use probabilistic embeddings to model this input uncertainty. Experimental results show that our embedding model achieves higher accuracy when retrieving similar poses across different camera views, in comparison with 2D-to-3D pose lifting models.

Use of deformation transfer or multilinear tensor as a personalized 3DMM for blendshape interpolation does not address the fact that facial expressions result in different local and global skin deformations in different persons. Moreover, existing methods learn a single albedo per user which is not enough to capture the expression-specific skin reflectance variations. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly learns a personalized face model per user and per-frame facial motion parameters from a large corpus of in-the-wild videos of user expressions. Specifically, we learn user-specific expression blendshapes and dynamic (expression-specific) albedo maps by predicting personalized corrections on top of a 3DMM prior. We introduce novel training constraints to ensure that the corrected blendshapes retain their semantic meanings and the reconstructed geometry is disentangled from the albedo. Experimental results show that our personalization accurately captures fine-grained facial dynamics in a wide range of conditions and efficiently decouples the learned face model from facial motion, resulting in more accurate face reconstruction and facial motion retargeting compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing OBB approaches are mostly built on horizontal bounding box detectors by introducing an additional angle dimension optimized by a distance loss. However, as the distance loss only minimizes the angle error of the OBB and that it loosely correlates to the IoU, it is insensitive to objects with high aspect ratios. Therefore, a novel loss, Pixels-IoU (PIoU) Loss, is formulated to exploit both the angle and IoU for accurate OBB regression. The PIoU loss is derived from IoU metric with a pixel-wise form, which is simple and suitable for both horizontal and oriented bounding box. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluate the PIoU loss on both anchor-based and anchor-free frameworks. The experimental results show that PIoU loss can dramatically improve the performance of OBB detectors, particularly on objects with high aspect ratios and complex backgrounds. Besides, previous evaluation datasets did not include scenarios where the objects have high aspect ratios, hence a new dataset, Retail50K, is introduced to encourage the community to adapt OBB detectors for more complex environments.",

Then we gradually reduce the weight of ground truth excitations by a curriculum rate and replace it by a curriculum complementary map for better and faster convergence. In particular, the spatial excitation strengthens feature activations for clear object boundaries, while the temporal excitation imposes motions to emphasize spatio-temporal salient regions. Spatial and temporal excitations can combat the saliency shifting problem and conflict between spatial and temporal features of VSOD. Furthermore, our semi-curriculum learning design enables the first online refinement strategy for VSOD, which allows exciting and boosting saliency responses during testing without re-training.

In this paper, we propose a new gaze estimation dataset called ETH-XGaze, consisting of over one million high-resolution images of varying gaze under extreme head poses. We collect this dataset from 110 participants with a custom hardware setup including 18 digital SLR cameras and adjustable illumination conditions, and a calibrated system to record ground truth gaze targets. We show that our dataset can significantly improve the robustness of gaze estimation methods across different head poses and gaze angles. Additionally, we define a standardized experimental protocol and evaluation metric on ETH-XGaze, to better unify gaze estimation research going forward. The dataset and benchmark website are available at https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2020/ETH-XGaze",

		"abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of Structure-from-Motion from images with unknown intrinsic calibration. Instead of estimating the internal camera parameters through some self-calibration procedure, we propose to use a subset of the reprojection constraints that is invariant to radial displacement. This allows us to recover metric 3D reconstructions without explicitly estimating the cameras' focal length or radial distortion parameters. The weaker projection model makes initializing the reconstruction especially difficult. To handle this additional challenge we propose two novel minimal solvers for radial trifocal tensor estimation. We evaluate our approach on real images and show that even for extreme optical systems, such as fisheye or catadioptric, we are able to get accurate reconstructions without performing any calibration.",

		"abstract": "State-of-the-art navigation methods leverage a spatial memory to generalize to new environments, but their occupancy maps are limited to capturing the geometric structures directly observed by the agent. We propose occupancy anticipation, where the agent uses its egocentric RGB-D observations to infer the occupancy state beyond the visible regions. In doing so, the agent builds its spatial awareness more rapidly, which facilitates efficient exploration and navigation in 3D environments. By exploiting context in both the egocentric views and top-down maps our model successfully anticipates a broader map of the environment, with performance significantly better than strong baselines. Furthermore, when deploying our model for the sequential decision-making tasks of exploration and navigation, we outperform state-of-the-art methods on the Gibson and Matterport3D datasets.

While image saliency modeling is a well-studied problem and progress on benchmarks like SALICON and MIT300 is slowing, video saliency models have shown rapid gains on the recent DHF1K benchmark. Here, we take a step back and ask: Can image and video saliency modeling be approached via a unified model, with mutual benefit? We identify different sources of domain shift between image and video saliency data and between different video saliency datasets as a key challenge for effective joint modelling. To address this we propose four novel domain adaptation techniques - Domain-Adaptive Priors, Domain-Adaptive Fusion, Domain-Adaptive Smoothing and Bypass-RNN - in addition to an improved formulation of learned Gaussian priors. We integrate these techniques into a simple and lightweight encoder-RNN-decoder-style network, UNISAL, and train it jointly with image and video saliency data. We evaluate our method on the video saliency datasets DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports, and the image saliency datasets SALICON and MIT300. With one set of parameters, UNISAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on all video saliency datasets and is on par with the state-of-the-art for image saliency datasets, despite faster runtime and a 5 to 20-fold smaller model size compared to all competing deep methods. We provide retrospective analyses and ablation studies which confirm the importance of the domain shift modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/rdroste/unisal.",

		"abstract": "For many years, multi-object tracking benchmarks have focused on a handful of categories. Motivated primarily by surveillance and self-driving applications, these datasets provide tracks for people, vehicles, and animals, ignoring the vast majority of objects in the world. By contrast, in the related field of object detection, the introduction of large-scale, diverse datasets (e.g., COCO) have fostered significant progress in developing highly robust solutions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a similarly diverse dataset for Tracking Any Object (TAO). It consists of 2,907 high resolution videos, captured in diverse environments, which are half a minute long on average. Importantly, we adopt a bottom-up approach for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an order of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks. To this end, we ask annotators to label objects that move at any point in the video, and give names to them post factum. Our vocabulary is both significantly larger and qualitatively different from existing tracking datasets. To ensure scalability of annotation, we employ a federated approach that focuses manual effort on labeling tracks for those relevant objects in a video (e.g., those that move). We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers and make a number of important discoveries regarding large-vocabulary tracking in an open-world. In particular, we show that existing single- and multi-object trackers struggle when applied to this scenario in the wild, and that detection-based, multi-object trackers are in fact competitive with user-initialized ones. We hope that our dataset and analysis will boost further progress in the tracking community.",

To confront these challenges we introduce SYNC-policies (synchronize your actions coherently) and CORDIAL (coordination loss). Using SYNC-policies and CORDIAL, our agents achieve a 58% completion rate on FurnMove, an impressive absolute gain of 25 percentage points over competitive decentralized baselines.

We build on a C3D encoder for spatio-temporal video blocks to capture short-range action patterns. Such encoded blocks are aggregated by permutation-invariant pooling to make our approach robust to varying action lengths and long-range temporal dependencies whose patterns are unlikely to repeat even in clips of the same class. Subsequently, the pooled representations are combined into simple relation descriptors which encode so-called query and support clips. Finally, relation descriptors are fed to the comparator with the goal of similarity learning between query and support clips. Importantly, to re-weight block contributions during pooling, we exploit spatial and temporal attention modules and self-supervision. In naturalistic clips (of the same class) there exists a temporal distribution shift--the locations of discriminative temporal action hotspots vary. Thus, we permute blocks of a clip and align the resulting attention regions with similarly permuted attention regions of non-permuted clip to train the attention mechanism invariant to block (and thus long-term hotspot) permutations.

Anchor boxes are densely proposed over the images and the network is trained to predict the boxes position offset as well as the classification confidence. Existing systems pre-define anchor box shapes and sizes and ad-hoc heuristic adjustments are used to define the anchor configurations. However, this might be sub-optimal or even wrong when a new dataset or a new model is adopted. In this paper, we study the problem of automatically optimizing anchor boxes for object detection. We first demonstrate that the number of anchors, anchor scales and ratios are crucial factors for a reliable object detection system. By carefully analyzing the existing bounding box patterns on the feature hierarchy, we design a flexible and tight hyper-parameter space for anchor configurations. Then we propose a novel hyper-parameter optimization method named AABO to determine more appropriate anchor boxes for a certain dataset, in which Bayesian Optimization and subsampling method are combined to achieve precise and efficient anchor configuration optimization. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on different detectors and datasets, e.g. achieving around 2.4% mAP improvement on COCO, 1.6% on ADE and 1.5% on VG, and the optimal anchors can bring 1.4% ∼ 2.4% mAP improvement on SOTA detectors by only optimizing anchor configurations, e.g. boosting Mask RCNN from 40.3% to 42.3%, and HTC detector from 46.8% to 48.2%.",

We fill this gap by presenting a large-scale ``Holistic Video Understanding Dataset\"\"~(HVU). HVU is organized hierarchically in a semantic taxonomy that focuses on multi-label and multi-task video understanding as a comprehensive problem that encompasses the recognition of multiple semantic aspects in the dynamic scene. HVU contains approx.~572k videos in total with 9 million annotations for training, validation, and test set spanning over 3142 labels. HVU encompasses semantic aspects defined on categories of scenes, objects, actions, events, attributes, and concepts which naturally capture the real-world scenarios.We demonstrate the generalisation capability of HVU on three challenging tasks: 1.) Video classification, 2.) Video captioning and 3.) Video clustering tasks. In particular for video classification, we introduce a new spatio-temporal deep neural network architecture called ``Holistic Appearance and Temporal Network\"\"~(HATNet) that builds on fusing 2D and 3D architectures into one by combining intermediate representations of appearance and temporal cues. HATNet focuses on the multi-label and multi-task learning problem and is trained in an end-to-end manner. %The experiments show that HATNet trained on HVU outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on challenging human action datasets: HMDB51, UCF101, and Kinetics.

In this paper, we show that the resulting networks are sensitive not only to global adversarial attacks, where perturbations affect the entire input image, but also to indirect local attacks, where the perturbations are confined to a small image region that does not overlap with the area that the attacker aims to fool. To this end, we introduce an indirect attack strategy, namely adaptive local attacks, aiming to find the best image location to perturb, while preserving the labels at this location and producing a realistic-looking segmentation map. Furthermore, we propose attack detection techniques both at the global image level and to obtain a pixel-wise localization of the fooled regions. Our results are unsettling: Because they exploit a larger context, more accurate semantic segmentation networks are more sensitive to indirect local attacks. We believe that our comprehensive analysis will motivate the community to design architectures with contextual dependencies that do not trade off robustness for accuracy.",

In this paper, we propose the bounding-box channels, a novel architecture capable of relating the semantic, spatial, and image features strongly. Our network learns bounding-box channels, which are initialized according to the position of the objects and the label of objects, and concatenated to the image features extracted from the objects. Then, they are input together to the relationship estimator. Our method can retain the spatial information in the image features, and strongly associate them with the semantic and spatial features. This way, our method is capable of effectively emphasizing the features in the object area for a better modeling of the relationships within objects.

To fully explore the potential of the weak labels, we propose to impose separate treatments of strong and weak annotations via a strong-weak dual-branch network, which discriminates the massive inaccurate weak supervisions from those strong ones. We design a shared network component to exploit the joint discrimination of strong and weak annotations; meanwhile, the proposed dual branches separately handle full and weak supervised learning and effectively eliminate their mutual interference. This simple architecture requires only slight additional computational costs during training yet brings significant improvements over the previous methods. Experiments on two standard benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

		"abstract": "Deep learning-based image denoising approaches have been extensively studied in recent years, prevailing in many public benchmark datasets. However, the stat-of-the-art networks are computationally too expensive to be directly applied on mobile devices. In this work, we propose a light-weight, efficient neural network-based raw image denoiser that runs smoothly on mainstream mobile devices, and produces high quality denoising results. Our key insights are twofold:(1) by measuring and estimating sensor noise level, a smaller network trained on synthetic sensor-specific data can out-perform larger ones trained on general data;(2) the large noise level variation under different ISO settings can be removed by a novel k-Sigma Transform, allowing a small network to efficiently handle a wide range of noise levels. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach. Our proposed mobile-friendly denoising model runs at ~70 milliseconds per megapixel on Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset, and it is the basis of the night shot feature of several flagship smartphones released in 2019.",

One of the problems of the VLN task is data scarcity since it is difficult to collect enough navigation paths with human-annotated instructions for interactive environments. In this paper, we explore the use of counterfactual thinking as a human-inspired data augmentation method that results in robust models. Counterfactual thinking is a concept that describes the human propensity to create possible alternatives to life events that have already occurred. We propose an adversarial-driven counterfactual reasoning model that can consider effective conditions instead of low-quality augmented data. In particular, we present a model-agnostic adversarial path sampler (APS) that learns to sample challenging paths that force the navigator to improve based on the navigation performance. APS also serves to do pre-exploration of unseen environments to strengthen the model's ability to generalize. We evaluate the influence of APS on the performance of different VLN baseline models using the room-to-room dataset (R2R).

While conventional methods were successful in various tasks such as color and texture transfer between images, none could effectively work with the custom filter effects that are applied by users through various platforms like Instagram. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of style transfer, Filter Style Transfer (FST). Unlike conventional style transfer, new technique FST can extract and transfer custom filter style from a filtered style image to a content image. FST first infers the original image from a filtered reference via image-to-image translation. Then it estimates filter parameters from the difference between them. To resolve the ill-posed nature of reconstructing the original image from the reference, we represent each pixel color of an image to class mean and deviation. Besides, to handle the intra-class color variation, we propose an uncertainty based weighted least square method for restoring an original image. To the best of our knowledge, FST is the first style transfer method that can transfer custom filter effects between FHD image under 2ms on a mobile device without any textual context loss.",

		"abstract": "State-of-the-art single depth image-based 3D hand pose estimation methods are based on dense predictions, including voxel-to-voxel predictions, point-to-point regression, and pixel-wise estimations. Despite the good performance, those methods have a few issues in nature, such as the poor trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and plain feature representation learning with local convolutions. In this paper, a novel pixel-wise prediction-based method is proposed to address the above issues. The key ideas are two-fold: a) explicitly modeling the dependencies among joints and the relations between the pixels and the joints for better local feature representation learning; b) unifying the dense pixel-wise offset predictions and direct joint regression for end-to-end training. Specifically, we first propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based joint graph reasoning module to model the complex dependencies among joints and augment the representation capability of each pixel. Then we densely estimate all pixels' offsets to joints in both image plane and depth space and calculate the joints' positions by a weighted average over all pixels' predictions, totally discarding the complex post-processing operations. The proposed model is implemented with an efficient 2D fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone and has only about 1.4M parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D hand pose estimation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy while running very efficiently with around a speed of 110fps on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU.",

Therefore we cast the skin segmentation problem as that of target-independent Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) where we use the data from the Red-channel of the visible-range to develop skin segmentation algorithm on NIR images. We propose a method for target-independent segmentation where the 'nearest-clone' of a target image in the source domain is searched and used as a proxy in the segmentation network trained only on the source domain. We prove the existence of 'nearest-clone' and propose a method to find it through an optimization algorithm over the latent space of a Deep generative model based on variational inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for NIR skin segmentation over the state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods on the two newly created skin segmentation datasets in NIR domain despite not having access to the target NIR data. Additionally, we report state-of-the-art results for adaption from Synthia to Cityscapes which is a popular setting in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation.

		"abstract": "bit and lower precision mobile models are required due to the ever-increasing demand for better energy efficiency in mobile devices. In this work, we report that the activation instability induced by weight quantization (AIWQ) is the key obstacle to sub-4-bit quantization of mobile networks. To alleviate the AIWQ problem, we propose a novel training method called PROgressive-Freezing Iterative Training (PROFIT), which attempts to freeze layers whose weights are affected by the instability problem stronger than the other layers. We also propose a differentiable and unified quantization method (DuQ) and a negative padding idea to support asymmetric activation functions such as h-swish. We evaluate the proposed methods by quantizing MobileNet-v1, v2, and v3 on ImageNet and report that 4-bit quantization offers comparable (within 1.48 % top-1 accuracy) accuracy to full precision baseline. In the ablation study of the 3-bit quantization of MobileNet-v3, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a large margin, 12.86 % of top-1 accuracy.

The task aims at spatio-temporally localizing the given relations in the form of subject-predicate-object in the videos, so as to provide supportive visual facts for other high-level video-language tasks (e.g., video-language grounding and video question answering). The challenges in this task include but not limited to: (1) both the subject and object are required to be spatio-temporally localized to ground a query relation; (2) the temporal dynamic nature of visual relations in videos is difficult to capture; and (3) the grounding should be achieved without any direct supervision in space and time. To ground the relations, we tackle the challenges by collaboratively optimizing two sequences of regions over a constructed hierarchical spatio-temporal region graph through relation attending and reconstruction, in which we further propose a message passing mechanism by spatial attention shifting between visual entities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can not only outperform baseline approaches significantly, but also produces visually meaningful facts to support visual grounding.

Essential to learning is leveraging effective 3D human priors, and the ability to work under weak supervision, at scale, by exploiting, to the largest extent, the detailed human body semantics in images. In this paper we present new priors as well as large-scale weakly supervised models for 3D human pose and shape estimation. Key to our formulation are new latent normalizing flow representations, as well as fully differentiable, structurally-sensitive, semantic body part alignment(re-projection) loss functions that ensure consistent estimates and sharp feedback signals for learning. In extensive experiments using both motion capture datasets like CMU, Human3.6M, 3DPW, or AMASS, and repositories like COCO, we show that our proposed methods outperform existing counterparts, supporting the construction of an increasingly more accurate family of models based on large-scale training with unlabeled image data.",

Event-based sensors deliver high temporal resolution motion information in a sparse, non-redundant format. This creates the potential for low computation, low latency motion recognition. Neural networks which extract global motion information, however, are generally computationally expensive. Here, we introduce a novel shallow and compact neural architecture and learning approach to capture reliable visual motion information along with the corresponding confidence of inference. Our network makes a prediction of the visual motion at each spatial location using only local events. Our confidence network then identifies which of these predictions will be accurate. In the task of recovering pan-tilt ego velocities from events, we show that each individual confident local prediction of our network can be expected to be as accurate as state of the art optimization approaches which utilize the full image. Furthermore, on a publicly available dataset, we find our local predictions generalize to scenes with camera motions and the presence of independently moving objects. This makes the output of our network well suited for motion based tasks, such as the segmentation of independently moving objects. We demonstrate on a publicly available motion segmentation dataset that restricting predictions to confident regions is sufficient to achieve results that exceed state of the art methods.",

The main goal of DVC is video story description, that is, to generate a concise video story that supports human video comprehension without watching it. In recent years, DVC has attracted increasing attention in the research community of Vision and Language, and has been employed as a task of the workshop, ActivityNet Challenge. In the current research community, the official scorer provided by AcivityNet Challenge is the de-facto standard evaluation framework for DVC systems. It computes averaged METEOR scores for matched pairs between generated and reference captions whose Interval of Union (IoU) exceeds a specific threshold value. However, the current framework does not take into account the story of the video, the ordering of captions. It also tends to give high scores to systems that generate redundant, several hundred captions, that humans cannot read. This paper proposes a new evaluation framework, Story Oriented Dense video cAptioning evaluation framework (SODA), for measuring the performance of video story description systems. SODA first tries to find temporally optimal matching between generated and reference captions to capture a story for a video. Then, it computes METEOR scores for the matching and derives F-measure scores from the METEOR scores to penalize redundant captions. To demonstrate that SODA gives low scores for inadequate captions in terms of video story description, we evaluate two state-of-the-art systems with it, varying the number of captions. The results show that SODA can give low scores against too many or too few captions and high scores against captions whose number equals to that of a reference, while the current framework gives good scores for all the cases. Furthermore, we show that SODA tends to give lower scores than the current evaluation framework in evaluating captions with incorrect order.",

		"title": "Sketch-Guided Object Localization in Natural Images",
		"abstract": "We introduce a novel problem of localizing all the instances of an object (seen or unseen during training) in a natural image via sketch query. We refer to this problem as sketch-guided object localization. This problem is distinctively different from the traditional sketch-based image retrieval task where the gallery set often contains images with only one object. The sketch-guided object localization proves to be more challenging when we consider the following: (i) the sketches used as queries are abstract representations with little information on the shape and salient attributes of the object, (ii) the sketches have significant variability as they are hand-drawn by a diverse set of untrained human subjects, and (iii) there exists a domain gap between sketch queries and target natural images as these are sampled from very different data distributions. To address the problem of sketch-guided object localization, we propose a novel \u001bmph{cross-modal attention} scheme that guides the region proposal network (RPN) to generate object proposals relevant to the sketch query. These object proposals are later scored against the query to obtain final localization. Our method is effective with as little as a single sketch query. Moreover, it also generalizes well to object categories not seen during training and is effective in localizing multiple object instances present in the image. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a multi-query setting using novel feature fusion and attention fusion strategies introduced in this paper. The localization performance is evaluated on publicly available object detection benchmarks, viz. MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC, with sketch queries obtained from `Quick, Draw!'. The proposed method significantly outperforms related baselines on both single-query and multi-query localization tasks.",

		"abstract": "Recently, substantial research efforts in Deep Metric Learning (DML) focused on designing complex pairwise-distance losses, which require convoluted schemes to ease optimization, such as sample mining or pair weighting. The standard cross-entropy loss for classification has been largely overlooked in DML. On the surface, the cross-entropy may seem unrelated and irrelevant to metric learning as it does not explicitly involve pairwise distances. However, we provide a theoretical analysis that links the cross-entropy to several well-known and recent pairwise losses. Our connections are drawn from two different perspectives: one based on an explicit optimization insight; the other on discriminative and generative views of the mutual information between the labels and the learned features. First, we explicitly demonstrate that the cross-entropy is an upper bound on a new pairwise loss, which has a structure similar to various pairwise losses: it minimizes intra-class distances while maximizing inter-class distances. As a result, minimizing the cross-entropy can be seen as an approximate bound-optimization (or Majorize-Minimize) algorithm for minimizing this pairwise loss. Second, we show that, more generally,minimizing the cross-entropy is actually equivalent to maximizing the mutual information, to which we connect several well-known pairwise losses. Furthermore, we show that various standard pairwise losses can be explicitly related to one another via bound relationships. Our findings indicate that the cross-entropy represents a proxy for maximizing the mutual information – as pairwise losses do – without the need for convoluted sample-mining heuristics. Our experiments†over four standard DML benchmarks strongly support our findings. We obtain state-of-the-art results, outperforming recent and complex DML methods.",

To reveal the secrets behind the scene, we present VALUE (Vision-And-Language Understanding Evaluation), a set of meticulously designed probing tasks (e.g., Visual Coreference Resolution, Visual Relation Detection) generalizable to standard pre-trained V+L models, to decipher the inner workings of multimodal pre-training (e.g., implicit knowledge garnered in individual attention heads, inherent cross-modal alignment learned through contextualized multimodal embeddings). Through extensive analysis of each archetypal model architecture via these probing tasks, our key observations are: (i) Pre-trained models exhibit a propensity for attending over text rather than images during inference. (ii) There exists a subset of attention heads that are tailored for capturing cross-modal interactions. (iii) Learned attention matrix in pre-trained models demonstrates patterns coherent with the latent alignment between image regions and textual words. (iv) Plotted attention patterns reveal visually-interpretable relations among image regions. (v) Pure linguistic knowledge is also effectively encoded in the attention heads.

		"title": "STAR: Sparse Trained Articulated Human Body Regressor",
		"abstract": "The SMPL body model is widely used for the estimation, synthesis, and analysis of 3D human pose and shape. While popular, we show that SMPL has several limitations and introduce STAR, which is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to SMPL. First, SMPL has a huge number of parameters resulting from its use of global blend shapes. These dense pose-corrective offsets relate every vertex on the mesh to all the joints in the kinematic tree, capturing spurious long-range cor- relations. To address this, we define per-joint pose correctives and learn the subset of mesh vertices that are influenced by each joint movement. This sparse formulation results in more realistic deformations and significantly reduces the number of model parameters to 20% of SMPL. When trained on the same data as SMPL, STAR generalizes better despite having many fewer parameters. Second, SMPL factors pose-dependent deformations from body shape while, in reality, people with different shapes deform differently. Consequently, we learn shape-dependent pose- corrective blendshapes that depend on both body pose and BMI. Third, we show that the shape space of SMPL is not rich enough to capture the variation in the human population. We address this by training STAR with an additional 10,000 scans of male and female subjects, and show that this results in better model generalization. STAR is compact, generalizes better to new bodies and is a drop-in replacement for SMPL. STAR is publicly available for research purposes at http://star.is.tue.mpg.de.",

The output difference between these two teacher networks highlights the improvements made by optical flow, which is then adopted to distill the target student network. Furthermore, a low-rank distillation loss is employed to stabilize the output of student network by mimicking the rank of input videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our student network without an optical flow module is still able to generate stable video and runs much faster than the teacher network.",

The two steps, which we term as the collaboration and competition step respectively, are performed alternatively until the balance of the competition is reached for the ultimate collaboration.

Both Trial-driven IL and TPN underlie robust navigation policy, instructing the agent to escape from deadlock states, such as looping or being stuck. Specifically, trial-driven IL is a type of supervision used in policy network training, while TPN, mimicking the IL supervision in unseen environment, is applied in testing. %instructing an agent to escape from deadlock states. Experiment in the artificial environment AI2-Thor validates that each of the techniques is effective. When combined, the techniques bring significantly improvement over baseline methods in navigation effectiveness and efficiency in unseen environments. We report 22.8\\% and 23.5\\% increase in success rate and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), respectively. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/xiaobaishu0097/ECCV-VN.git}.",

		"title": "Adversarial Self-Supervised Learning for Semi-Supervised 3D Action Recognition",
		"abstract": "We consider the problem of semi-supervised 3D action recognition which has been rarely explored before. Its major challenge lies in how to effectively learn motion representations from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proved very effective at learning representations from unlabeled data in the image domain. However, few effective self-supervised approaches exist for 3D action recognition, and directly applying SSL for semi-supervised learning suffers from misalignment of representations learned from SSL and supervised learning tasks. To address these issues, we present Adversarial Self-Supervised Learning (ASSL), a novel framework that tightly couples SSL and the semi-supervised scheme via neighbor relation exploration and adversarial learning. Specifically, we design an effective SSL scheme to improve the discrimination capability of learned representations for 3D action recognition, through exploring the data relations within a neighborhood. We further propose an adversarial regularization to align the feature distributions of labeled and unlabeled samples. To demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed ASSL in semi-supervised 3D action recognition, we conduct extensive experiments on NTU and N-UCLA datasets. The results confirm its advantageous performance over state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods in the few label regime for 3D action recognition.",

		"title": "Across Scales & Across Dimensions: Temporal Super-Resolution using Deep Internal Learning",
		"abstract": "When a very fast dynamic event is recorded with a low-framerate camera, the resulting video suffers from severe motion blur (due to exposure time) and motion aliasing (due to low sampling rate in time). True Temporal Super-Resolution (TSR) is more than just Temporal-Interpolation (increasing framerate). It can also recover new high temporal frequencies beyond the temporal Nyquist limit of the input video, thus resolving both motion-blur and motion aliasing – effects that temporal frame interpolation (as sophisticated as it may be) cannot undo. In this paper we propose a “Deep Internal Learning” approach for true TSR. We train a video-specific FCN on examples extracted directly from the low-framerate input video. Our method exploits the strong recurrence of small space-time patches inside a single video sequence, both within and across different spatio-temporal scales of the video.We further observe (for the first time) that small space-time patches recur also across-dimensions of the video sequence – i.e., by swapping the spatial and temporal dimensions. In particular, the higher spatial resolution of video frames provides strong examples as to how to increase the temporal resolution of that video. Such internal video-specific examples give rise to strong self-supervision, requiring no data but the input video itself. This results in Zero-Shot Temporal-SR of complex videos, which removes both motion blur and motion aliasing, outperforming previous supervised methods trained on external video datasets.",

		"abstract": "Conditional GANs (cGANs) are widely used in translating an image from one category to another. Meaningful conditions on GANsprovide greater flexibility and control over the nature of the target domain synthetic data. Existing conditional GANs commonly encode target domain label information as hard-coded categorical vectors in the form of0s and 1s. The major drawbacks of such representations are inability to encode the high-order semantic information of target categories and their relative dependencies. We propose a novel end-to-end learning framework based on Graph Convolutional Networks to learn the attribute representations to condition the generator. The GAN losses, the discriminator and attribute classification loss, are fed back to the graph resulting in the synthetic images that are more natural and clearer with respect to the attributes generation. Moreover, prior-arts are mostly given priorities to condition on the generator side, not on the discriminator side of GANs.We apply the conditions on the discriminator side as well via multi-task learning. We enhanced four state-of-the-art cGANs architectures: Stargan, Stargan-JNT, AttGAN and STGAN. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging face attributes manipulation data set,CelebA, LFWA, and RaFD, show that the cGANs enhanced by our meth-ods outperform by a large margin, compared to their counter-parts and other conditioning methods, in terms of both target attributes recognition rates and quality measures such as PSNR and SSIM.",

The refinement process is guided by a consistency loss, which combines stereo and temporal photo-consistency with a geometric term that couples disparity and 3D motion. To handle inherent modeling error in the consistency loss (e.g. Lambertian assumptions) and for better generalization, we further introduce a learned, output refinement network, which takes the initial predictions, the loss, and the gradient as input, and efficiently predicts a correlated output update.

For a given input, the model produces a pair of predictions with two valid orderings, and is then trained to maximize the mutual information between the two outputs. These outputs can either be low-dimensional features for representation learning or output clusters corresponding to semantic labels for clustering. While masked convolutions are used during training, in inference, no masking is applied and we fall back to the standard convolution where the model has access to the full input.

On the other hand, reference-based SR (Ref-SR) methods can transfer textures to some extent, but is still impractical to handle very large factors and keep fidelity with original input. To solve these problems, we propose an efficient high-resolution hallucination network for very large scaling factors with efficient network structure and feature transferring. To transfer more detailed textures, we design a wavelet texture loss, which helps to enhance more high-frequency components. At the same time, to reduce the smoothing effect brought by the image reconstruction loss, we further relax the reconstruction constraint with a degradation loss which ensures the consistency between downscaled super-resolution results and low-resolution inputs. We also collected a high-resolution (\u001bg 4K resolution) painting dataset PaintHD by considering both physical size and image resolution.

However, two key points related to data augmentation remain uncovered by the current methods. First is that most if not all modern augmentation search methods are extit{offline} where learning policies are isolated from their usage. The learned policies are mostly constant throughout the training process and are extit{not adapted} to the current training model state. Second, the policies rely on class-preserving image processing functions. Hence applying current offline methods to new tasks may require domain knowledge to specify such kind of operations. In this work, we offer an orthogonal extit{online} data augmentation scheme together with three new augmentation networks, co-trained with the target learning task. It is both more efficient, in the sense that it does not require expensive offline training when entering a new domain, and more adaptive as it adapts to the learner state.

However, given a finite collection of 3D shapes, even the closest model to a query may not be satisfactory. This motivates us to apply 3D model deformation techniques to adapt the retrieved model so as to better fit the query. Yet, certain restrictions are enforced in most 3D deformation techniques to preserve important features of the original model that prevent a perfect fitting of the deformed model to the query. This gap between the deformed model and the query induces \u001bmph{asymmetric} relationships among the models, which cannot be handled by typical metric learning techniques.

To make RGB-based vision models workable for the low-lighting scenario, prior methods focus on learning the colorization on depth maps captured by depth cameras, such that the vision models can still achieve reasonable performance on colorized depth maps. However, the colorization produced in this manner is usually unrealistic and constrained to the specific vision model, thus being hard to generalize for other tasks to use. In this paper, we propose a depth map colorization method via disentangling appearance and structure factors, so that our model could 1) learn depth-invariant appearance features from an appearance reference and 2) generate colorized images by combining a given depth map and the appearance feature obtained from any reference. We conduct extensive experiments to show that our colorization results are more realistic and diverse in comparison to several image translation baselines.",

		"title": "Beyond Controlled Environments: 3D Camera Re-Localization in Changing Indoor Scenes",
		"abstract": "Long-term camera re-localization is an important task with numerous computer vision and robotics applications. Whilst various outdoor benchmarks exist that target lighting, weather and seasonal changes, far less attention has been paid to appearance changes that occur indoors. This has led to a mismatch between popular indoor benchmarks, which focus on static scenes, and indoor environments that are of interest for many real-world applications. In this paper, we adapt 3RScan -- a recently introduced indoor RGB-D dataset designed for object instance re-localization -- to create RIO10, a new long-term camera re-localization benchmark focused on indoor scenes. We propose new metrics for evaluating camera re-localization and explore how state-of-the-art camera re-localizers perform according to these metrics. We also examine in detail how different types of scene change affect the performance of different methods, based on novel ways of detecting such changes in a given RGB-D frame. Our results clearly show that long-term indoor re-localization is an unsolved problem. Our benchmark and tools are publicly available at waldjohannau.github.io/RIO",

The start and end of an action in a long untrimmed video is determined based on just a hand-full of trimmed video examples containing the same action, without knowing their common class label. To address this task, we introduce a new 3D convolutional network architecture able to align representations from the support videos with the relevant query video segments. The network contains: (i) a mutual enhancement module to simultaneously complement the representation of the few trimmed support videos and the untrimmed query video; (ii) a progressive alignment module that iteratively fuses the support videos into the query branch; and (iii) a pairwise matching module to weigh the importance of different support videos. Evaluation of few-shot common action localization in untrimmed videos containing a single or multiple action instances demonstrates the effectiveness and general applicability of our proposal.",

While number of techniques have been proposed for FSL, several factors have emerged as most important for FSL performance, awarding SOTA even to the simplest of techniques. These are: the backbone architecture (bigger is better), type of pre-training on the base classes (meta-training vs regular multi-class, currently regular wins), quantity and diversity of the base classes set (the more the merrier, resulting in richer and better adaptive features), and the use of self-supervised tasks during pre-training (serving as a proxy for increasing the diversity of the base set). In this paper we propose yet another simple technique that is important for the few shot learning performance - a search for a compact feature sub-space that is discriminative for a given few-shot test task. We show that the Task-Adaptive Feature Sub-Space Learning (TAFSSL) can significantly boost the performance in FSL scenarios when some additional unlabeled data accompanies the novel few-shot task, be it either the set of unlabeled queries (transductive FSL) or some additional set of unlabeled data samples (semi-supervised FSL). Specifically, we show that on the challenging extit{mini}ImageNet and extit{tiered}ImageNet benchmarks, TAFSSL can improve the current state-of-the-art in both transductive and semi-supervised FSL settings by more than $5\\%$, while increasing the benefit of using unlabeled data in FSL to above $10\\%$ performance gain.",

Our dataset has the following two advantages over the existing ones, which would facilitate practical research for causality analysis. First, the decomposition of an accident into cause and effect events provides atomic cues for reasoning on a complex environment and planning future actions. Second, the prediction of cause and effect in an accident makes a system more interpretable to humans, which mitigates the ambiguity of legal liabilities among agents engaged in the accident.

Most existing FAS methods capture various cues (e.g., texture, depth and reflection) to distinguish the live faces from the spoofing faces. All these cues are based on the discrepancy among physical materials (e.g., skin, glass, paper and silicone). In this paper we rephrase face anti-spoofing as a material recognition problem and combine it with classical human material perception, intending to extract discriminative and robust features for FAS. To this end, we propose the Bilateral Convolutional Networks (BCN), which is able to capture intrinsic material-based patterns via aggregating multi-level bilateral macro- and micro- information. Furthermore, Multi-level Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and multi-head supervision are utilized to learn more robust features.

Furthermore, these systems may even misrepresent the image in order to produce a simpler caption consisting of common concepts.

We find that modern captioning systems return higher likelihoods for incorrect distractor sentences compared to ground truth captions, and that evaluation metrics like SPICE can be 'topped' using simple captioning systems relying on object detectors. Inspired by these observations, we design a new metric (SPICE-U) by introducing a notion of uniqueness over the concepts generated in a caption. We show that SPICE-U is better correlated with human judgements compared to SPICE, and effectively captures notions of diversity and descriptiveness. Finally, we also demonstrate a general technique to improve any existing captioning model -- by using mutual information as a re-ranking objective during decoding. Empirically, this results in more unique and informative captions, and improves three different state-of-the-art models on SPICE-U as well as average score over existing metrics.",

We present a method for deepfake detection based on a two-branch network structure that isolates digitally manipulated faces by learning to amplify artifacts while suppressing the high-level face content. Unlike current methods that extract spatial frequencies as a preprocessing step, we propose a two-branch structure: one branch propagates the original information, while the other branch suppresses the face content yet amplifies multi-band frequencies using a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) as a bottleneck layer. To better isolate manipulated faces, we derive a novel cost function that, unlike regular classification, compresses the variability of natural faces and pushes away the unrealistic facial samples in the feature space. Our two novel components show promising results on the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and Facebook's DFDC preview benchmarks, when compared to prior work. We then offer a full, detailed ablation study of our network architecture and cost function. Finally, although the bar is still high to get very remarkable figures at a very low false alarm rate, our study shows that we can achieve good video-level performance when cross-testing in terms of video-level AUC.",

Different tasks can have disjoint classes, so one cannot directly align different classifiers as done in model distillation. On the other hand, simply aligning features shared by all classes does not allow the base model sufficient flexibility to evolve to solve new tasks. We therefore indirectly align features relative to a minimal set of anchor classes. Such indirect discriminant alignment (IDA) adapts a new model to old classes without the need to re-process old data, while leaving maximum flexibility for the model to adapt to new tasks. This process enables incrementally improving the model by processing multiple learning episodes, each representing a different learning task, even with few training examples. Experiments on few-shot learning benchmarks show that this incremental approach performs favorably compared to training the model with the entire dataset at once.",

		"abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) methods have shown promising results discovering models that are both accurate and fast. For NAS, training a one-shot model has became a popular strategy to rank the relative quality of different architectures (child models) using a single set of shared weights. However, while one-shot model weights can effectively rank different network architectures, the absolute accuracies from these shared weights are typically far below those obtained from stand-alone training. To compensate, existing methods assume that the weights must be retrained, finetuned, or otherwise post-processed after the search is completed. These steps significantly increase the compute requirements and complexity of the architecture search and model deployment. In this work, we propose BigNAS, an approach that challenges the conventional wisdom that post-processing of the weights is necessary to get good prediction accuracies. Without extra retraining or post-processing steps, we are able to train a single set of shared weights on ImageNet and use these weights to obtain child models whose sizes range from 200 to 1000 MFLOPs. Our discovered model family, BigNASModels, achieve top-1 accuracies ranging from 76.5% to 80.9%, surpassing state-of-the-art models in this range including EfficientNets and Once-for-All networks without extra retraining or post-processing.

		"abstract": "Multi-person pose estimation is challenging because it localizes body keypoints for multiple persons simultaneously. Previous methods can be divided into two streams, \\ie top-down and bottom-up methods. The top-down methods localize keypoints after human detection, while the bottom-up methods localize keypoints directly and then cluster/group them for different persons, which are generally more efficient than top-down methods. However, in existing bottom-up methods, the keypoint grouping is usually solved independently from keypoint detection, making them not end-to-end trainable and have sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we investigate a new perspective of human part grouping and reformulate it as a graph clustering task. Especially, we propose a novel differentiable Hierarchical Graph Grouping (HGG) method to learn the graph grouping in bottom-up multi-person pose estimation task. Moreover, HGG is easily embedded into main-stream bottom-up methods. It takes human keypoint candidates as graph nodes and clusters keypoints in a multi-layer graph neural network model. The modules of HGG can be trained end-to-end with the keypoint detection network and is able to supervise the grouping process in a hierarchical manner. To improve the discrimination of the clustering, we add a set of edge discriminators and macro-node discriminators.

Unsupervised person ReID through domain adaptation is attractive yet challenging. Existing unsupervised ReID approaches often fail in correctly identifying the positive samples and negative samples through the distance-based matching/ranking. The two distributions of distances for positive sample pairs (Pos-distr) and negative sample pairs (Neg-distr) are often not well separated, having large overlap. To address this problem, we introduce a global distance-distributions separation (GDS) constraint over the two distributions to encourage the clear separation of positive and negative samples from a global view. We model the two global distance distributions as Gaussian distributions and push apart the two distributions while encouraging their sharpness in the unsupervised training process. Particularly, to model the distributions from a global view and facilitate the timely updating of the distributions and the GDS related losses, we leverage a momentum update mechanism for building and maintaining the distribution parameters (mean and variance) and calculate the loss on the fly during the training. Distribution-based hard mining is proposed to further promote the separation of the two distributions. We validate the effectiveness of the GDS constraint in unsupervised ReID networks.

Surface reconstruction is a prerequisite for down-stream applications such as rendering, collision avoidance for planning, animation, etc. However, the task is challenging if the input point cloud has a low resolution, which is common in real-world scenarios (e.g., from LiDAR or Kinect sensors). Existing learning-based mesh generative methods mostly predict the surface by first building a shape embedding that is at the whole object level, a design that causes issues in generating fine-grained details and generalizing to unseen categories. Instead, we propose to leverage the input point cloud as much as possible, by only adding connectivity information to existing points. Particularly, we predict which triplets of points should form faces. Our key innovation is a surrogate of local connectivity, calculated by comparing the intrinsic/extrinsic metrics. We learn to predict this surrogate using a deep point cloud network and then feed it to an efficient post-processing module for high-quality mesh generation. We demonstrate that our method can not only preserve details, handle ambiguous structures, but also possess strong generalizability to unseen categories by experiments on synthetic and real data.",

		"abstract": "Adversarial attack has recently become a tremendous threat to deep learning models. To improve model robustness, adversarial training, formulated as a minimax optimization problem, has been recognized as one of the most effective defense mechanisms. However, the non-convex and non-concave property poses a great challenge to the minimax training. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the commonly used PGD attack may not be optimal for inner maximization, and improved inner optimizer can lead to a more robust model. Then we leverage a learning-to-learn (L2L) framework to train an optimizer with recurrent neural networks (RNN), providing update directions and steps adaptively for the inner problem. By co-training optimizer's parameters and model's weights, the proposed framework consistently improves over PGD-based adversarial training and TRADES.",

DRealSR establishes a new SR benchmark with diverse real-world degradation processes, mitigating the limitations of conventional simulated image degradation. In general, the targets of SR vary with image regions with different low-level image components, e.g., smoothness preserving for flat regions, sharpening for edges, and detail enhancing for textures. Learning an SR model with conventional pixel-wise loss usually is easily dominated by flat regions and edges, and fails to infer realistic details of complex textures. We propose a Component Divide-and-Conquer (CDC) model and a Gradient-Weighted (GW) loss for SR. Our CDC parses an image with three components, employs three Component-Attentive Blocks (CABs) to learn attentive masks and intermediate SR predictions with an intermediate supervision learning strategy, and trains an SR model following a divide-and-conquer learning principle. Our GW loss also provides a feasible way to balance the difficulties of image components for SR. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our CDC and the challenging aspects of our DRealSR dataset related to diverse real-world scenarios.

		"title": "Enabling Deep Residual Networks for Weakly Supervised Object Detection",
		"abstract": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted extensive research attention due to its great flexibility of exploiting large-scale image-level annotation for detector training. Whilst deep residual networks such as ResNet and DenseNet have become the standard backbones for many computer vision tasks, the cutting-edge WSOD methods still rely on plain networks, e.g., VGG, as backbones. It is indeed not trivial to employ deep residual networks for WSOD, which even shows significant deterioration of detection accuracy and non-convergence. In this paper, we discover the intrinsic root with sophisticated analysis and propose a sequence of design principles to take full advantages of deep residual learning for WSOD from the perspectives of adding redundancy, improving robustness and aligning features. First, a redundant adaptation neck is key for effective object instance localization and discriminative feature learning. Second, small-kernel convolutions and MaxPool down-samplings help improve the robustness of information flow, which gives finer object boundaries and make the detector more sensitivity to small objects. Third, dilated convolution is essential to align the proposal features and exploit diverse local information by extracting high-resolution feature maps. Extensive experiments show that the proposed principles enable deep residual networks to establishes new state-of-the-arts on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.",

Near-light photometric stereo methods address near-light conditions but previous works are limited to over-simplified reflectances, such as Lambertian reflectance. The proposed method takes a hybrid approach of distant- and near-light models, where the surface normal of a small area (corresponding to a pixel) is computed locally with a distant light assumption, and the reconstruction error is assessed based on a near-light image formation model. This paper is the first work to solve unknown, spatially varying, diverse reflectances in near-light photometric stereo.",

To do so, motivated by the recent progresses in language models, we introduce {\u001bm image-conditioned masked language modeling} (ICMLM) -- a proxy task to learn visual representations over image-caption pairs. ICMLM consists in predicting masked words in captions by relying on visual cues. To tackle this task, we propose hybrid models, with dedicated visual and textual encoders, and we show that the visual representations learned as a by-product of solving this task transfer well to a variety of target tasks.

While modern classifiers perform well on populated classes, its performance degrades significantly on tail classes. Humans, however, are less affected by this since, when confronted with uncertain examples, they simply opt to provide coarser predictions. Motivated by this, a deep realistic taxonomic classifier (Deep-RTC) is proposed as a new solution to the long-tail problem, combining realism with hierarchical predictions. The model has the option to reject classifying samples at different levels of the taxonomy, once it cannot guarantee the desired performance. Deep-RTC is implemented with a stochastic tree sampling during training to simulate all possible classification conditions at finer or coarser levels and a rejection mechanism at inference time. Experiments on the long-tailed version of four datasets, CIFAR100, AWA2, Imagenet, and iNaturalist, demonstrate that the proposed approach preserves more information on all classes with different popularity levels.

By iteratively and hierarchically fusing the features across different layers of the CNN, our approach gains sufficient semantic information from the input image and pays special attention to the local boundaries with the help of ARM and GCN.

First, we propose a cross-modality feature modulation (cmFM) module to enhance feature representations by taking the depth features as prior, which models the complementary relations of RGB-D data. Second, we propose an adaptive feature selection (AFS) module to select saliency-related features and suppress the inferior ones. The AFS module exploits multi-modality spatial feature fusion with the self-modality and cross-modality interdependencies of channel features are considered. Third, we employ a saliency-guided position-edge attention (sg-PEA) module to encourage our network to focus more on saliency-related regions. The above modules as a whole, called cmMS block, facilitates the refinement of saliency features in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Coupled with a bottom-up inference, the refined saliency features enable accurate and edge-preserving SOD.

The main idea of recent fast ReID methods is the hashing algorithm, which learns compact binary codes and performs fast Hamming distance and counting sort. However, a very long code is needed for high accuracy (e.g. 2048), which compromises search speed. In this work, we introduce a new solution for fast ReID by formulating a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CtF) hashing code search strategy, which complementarily uses short and long codes, achieving both faster speed and better accuracy. It uses shorter codes to coarsely rank broad matching similarities and longer codes to refine only a few top candidates for more accurate instance ReID. Specifically, we design an All-in-One (AiO) framework together with a Distance Threshold Optimization (DTO) algorithm. In AiO, we simultaneously learn and enhance multiple codes of different lengths in a single model. It learns multiple codes in a pyramid structure, and encourage shorter codes to mimic longer codes by self-distillation. DTO solves a complex threshold search problem by a simple optimization process, and the balance between accuracy and speed is easily controlled by a single parameter. It formulates the optimization target as a $F_{\beta}$ score that can be optimised by Gaussian cumulative distribution functions. Experimental results on 2 datasets show that our proposed method (CtF) is not only 8% more accurate but also 5x faster than contemporary hashing ReID methods. Compared with non-hashing ReID methods, CtF is 50x faster with comparable accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid.",

Recently, pattern recognition algorithms, such as learning-based methods, have made significant progress with event cameras by converting events into synchronous dense, image-like representations and applying traditional machine learning methods developed for standard cameras. However, these approaches discard the spatial and temporal sparsity inherent in event data at the cost of higher computational complexity and latency. In this work, we present a general framework for converting models trained on synchronous image-like event representations into asynchronous models with identical output, thus directly leveraging the intrinsic asynchronous and sparse nature of the event data. We show both theoretically and experimentally that this drastically reduces the computational complexity and latency of high-capacity, synchronous neural networks without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, our framework has several desirable characteristics: (i) it exploits spatial and temporal sparsity in the event data explicitly, (ii) it is agnostic to the event representation, network architecture, and task, and (iii) it does not require any train-time change, since it is compatible with the standard neural net-works’ training process. We thoroughly validate the proposed framework on two computer vision tasks: object detection and object recognition.

		"abstract": "In this paper, we aim to develop an efficient and compact deep network for RGB-D salient object detection, where the depth image provides complementary information to boost performance in complex scenarios. Starting from a coarse initial prediction by a multi-scale residual block, we propose a progressively guided alternate refinement network to refine it. Instead of using ImageNet pre-trained backbone network, we first construct a lightweight depth stream by learning from scratch, which can extract complementary features more efficiently with less redundancy. Then, different from the existing fusion based methods, RGB and depth features are fed into proposed guided residual (GR) blocks alternately to reduce their mutual degradation. By assigning progressive guidance in the stacked GR blocks within each side-output, the false detection and missing parts can be well remedied. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, and also shows superiority in efficiency (71 FPS) and model size (64.9 MB).",

		"title": "Bottom-Up Temporal Action Localization with Mutual Regularization",
		"abstract": "Recently, temporal action localization (TAL), extit{i.e.}, finding specific action segments in untrimmed videos, has attracted increasing attentions of the computer vision community. State-of-the-art solutions for TAL involves evaluating the frame-level probabilities of three action-indicating phases, extit{i.e.} starting, continuing, and ending; and then post-processing these predictions for the final localization. This paper delves deep into this mechanism, and argues that existing methods, by modeling these phases as individual classification tasks, ignored the potential temporal constraints between them. This can lead to incorrect and/or inconsistent predictions when some frames of the video input lack sufficient discriminative information. To alleviate this problem, we introduce two regularization terms to mutually regularize the learning procedure: the Intra-phase Consistency (IntraC) regularization is proposed to make the predictions verified inside each phase; and the Inter-phase Consistency (InterC) regularization is proposed to keep consistency between these phases. Jointly optimizing these two terms, the entire framework is aware of these potential constraints during an end-to-end optimization process. Experiments are performed on two popular TAL datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3. Our approach clearly outperforms the baseline both quantitatively and qualitatively. The proposed regularization also generalizes to other TAL methods ( extit{e.g.}, TSA-Net and PGCN). code: https://github.com/PeisenZhao/Bottom-Up-TAL-with-MR",

To this end, we propose and study multiple complementary learning tasks, targeting conceptually different data relationships by only resorting to the available training samples and labels of a standard DML setting.

		"title": "DHP: Differentiable Meta Pruning via HyperNetworks",
		"abstract": "Network pruning has been the driving force for the acceleration of neural networks and the alleviation of model storage/transmission burden. With the advent of AutoML and neural architecture search (NAS), pruning has become topical with automatic mechanism and searching based architecture optimization. Yet, current automatic designs rely on either reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithm. Due to the non-differentiability of those algorithms, the pruning algorithm needs a long searching stage before reaching the convergence.  To circumvent this problem, this paper introduces a differentiable pruning method via hypernetworks for automatic network pruning. The specifically designed hypernetworks take latent vectors as input and generate the weight parameters of the backbone network. The latent vectors control the output channels of the convolutional layers in the backbone network and act as a handle for the pruning of the layers. By enforcing $\u001bll_1$ sparsity regularization to the latent vectors and utilizing proximal gradient solver, sparse latent vectors can be obtained. Passing the sparsified latent vectors through the hypernetworks, the corresponding slices of the generated weight parameters can be removed, achieving the effect of network pruning. The latent vectors of all the layers are pruned together, resulting in an automatic layer configuration. Extensive experiments are conducted on various networks for image classification, single image super-resolution, and denoising. And the experimental results validate the proposed method.

With limited training data, fine-tuning methods may suffer from the overfitting issue and substantial accuracy loss. To alleviate these issues, we introduce transfer learning into network quantization to obtain an accurate low-precision model. Specifically, we propose a method named deep transferring quantization (DTQ) to effectively exploit the knowledge in a pre-trained full-precision model. To this end, we propose a learnable attentive transfer module to identify the informative channels for alignment.

We design a new rotation detection baseline, to address the boundary problem by transforming angular prediction from a regression problem to a classification task with little accuracy loss, whereby high-precision angle classification is devised in contrast to previous works using coarse-granularity in rotation detection.

Learning to find an optimal mixed precision model that can preserve accuracy and satisfy the specific constraints on model size and computation is extremely challenge due to the difficult in training a mixed precision model and the huge space of all possible bit quantizations. In this paper, we propose a novel soft Barrier Penalty based NAS (BP-NAS) for mixed precision quantization, which ensures all the searched models are inside the valid domain defined by the complexity constraint, thus could return an optimal model under the given constraint by conducting search only one time. The proposed soft Barrier Penalty is differentiable and can impose very large losses to those models outside the valid domain while almost no punishment for models inside the valid domain, thus constraining the search only in the feasible domain.

BP-NAS sets new state of the arts on both classification (Cifar-10, ImageNet) and detection (COCO), surpassing all the efficient mixed precision methods designed manually and automatically.

To be specific, we formulate our framework with feature embedding using a multi-task learning paradigm. Besides conducting the common supervised recognition task, we seamlessly integrate a momentum metric learning task and a self-supervised auxiliary task to collectively utilize the extrinsic supervision and intrinsic supervision. Also, we develop an effective momentum metric learning scheme with K-hard negative mining to boost the network to capture image relationship for domain generalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two standard object recognition benchmarks VLCS and PACS, and show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

Who is interacting with whom, e.g. not everyone in a queue is interacting with each other, is often not predicted. There are scenarios where people are best to be split into sub-groups, which we call social groups, and each social group may be engaged in a different social activity. In this paper, we solve the problem of simultaneously grouping people by their social interactions, predicting their individual actions and the social activity of each social group, which we call the social task. Our main contributions are: i) we propose an end-to-end trainable framework for the social task; ii) our proposed method also sets the state-of-the-art results on two widely adopted benchmarks for the traditional group activity recognition task (assuming individuals of the scene form a single group and predicting a single group activity label for the scene); iii) we introduce new annotations on an existing group activity dataset, re-purposing it for the social task.",

		"title": "Whole-Body Human Pose Estimation in the Wild",
		"abstract": "This paper investigates the task of 2D human whole-body pose estimation, which aims to localize dense landmarks on the entire human body including face, hands, body, and feet. As existing datasets do not have whole-body annotations, previous methods have to assemble different deep models trained independently on different datasets of the human face, hand, and body, struggling with dataset biases and large model complexity. To fill in this blank, we introduce COCO-WholeBody which extends COCO dataset with whole-body annotations. To our best knowledge, it is the first benchmark that has manual annotations on the entire human body, including 133 dense landmarks with 68 on the face, 42 on hands and 23 on the body and feet. A single-network model, named ZoomNet, is devised to take into account the hierarchical structure of the full human body to solve the scale variation of different body parts of the same person. ZoomNet is able to significantly outperform existing methods on the proposed COCO-WholeBody dataset. Extensive experiments show that COCO-WholeBody not only can be used to train deep models from scratch for whole-body pose estimation but also can serve as a powerful pre-training dataset for many different tasks such as facial landmark detection and hand keypoint estimation. The dataset is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/jin-s13/COCO-WholeBody}.",

These problems reduces the minimal number of point pairs for relative pose estimation and improves the estimation efficiency and robustness. The $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariant constraints can come from extra sensor measurements or motion assumption. Different from conventional relative pose estimation with extra constraints, no extrinsic calibration is required to transform the constraints to the camera frame. This advantage comes from the invariance of $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariants cross different coordinate systems on a rigid body and makes the solvers more convenient and flexible in practical applications. Besides proposing the concept of relative pose estimation constrained by $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ invariants, we present a comprehensive study of existing polynomial formulations for relative pose estimation and discover their relationship. Different formulations are carefully chosen for each proposed problems to achieve best efficiency.

Prior methods take line detection as a special case of object detection, while neglect the inherent characteristics of lines, leading to less efficient and suboptimal results. We propose a one-shot end-to-end framework by incorporating the classical Hough transform into deeply learned representations. By parameterizing lines with slopes and biases, we perform Hough transform to translate deep representations to the parametric space and then directly detect lines in the parametric space. More concretely, we aggregate features along candidate lines on the feature map plane and then assign the aggregated features to corresponding locations in the parametric domain. Consequently, the problem of detecting semantic lines in the spatial domain is transformed to spotting individual points in the parametric domain, making the post-processing steps, i.e. non-maximal suppression, more efficient. Furthermore, our method makes it easy to extract contextual line features, that are critical to accurate line detection.

		"abstract": "D human shape and pose estimation from monocular images has been an active area of research in computer vision, having a substantial impact on the development of new applications, from activity recognition to creating virtual avatars. Existing deep learning methods for 3D human shape and pose estimation rely on relatively high-resolution input images; however, high-resolution visual content is not always available in several practical scenarios such as video surveillance and sports broadcasting. Low-resolution images in real scenarios can vary in a wide range of sizes, and a model trained in one resolution does not typically degrade gracefully across resolutions. Two common approaches to solve the problem of low-resolution input are applying super-resolution techniques to the input images which may result in visual artifacts, or simply training one model for each resolution, which is impractical in many realistic applications. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel algorithm called RSC-Net, which consists of a Resolution-aware network, a Self-supervision loss, and a Contrastive learning scheme. The proposed network is able to learn the 3D body shape and pose across different resolutions with a single model. The self-supervision loss encourages scale-consistency of the output, and the contrastive learning scheme enforces scale-consistency of the deep features. We show that both these new training losses provide robustness when learning 3D shape and pose in a weakly-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RSC-Net can achieve consistently better results than the state-of-the-art methods for challenging low-resolution images.",

For domain generalization, the goal is to learn from a set of source domains to produce a single model that will best generalize to an unseen target domain. As such, many prior approaches focus on learning representations which persist across all source domains with the assumption that these domain agnostic representations will generalize well. However, often individual domains contain characteristics which are unique and when leveraged can significantly aid in-domain recognition performance. To produce a model which best generalizes to both seen and unseen domains, we propose learning domain specific masks. The masks are encouraged to learn a balance of domain-invariant and domain-specific features, thus enabling a model which can benefit from the predictive power of specialized features while retaining the universal applicability of domain-invariant features.

		"title": "DLow: Diversifying Latent Flows for Diverse Human Motion Prediction",
		"abstract": "Deep generative models are often used for human motion prediction as they are able to model multi-modal data distributions and characterize diverse human behavior. While much care has been taken into designing and learning deep generative models, how to efficiently produce diverse samples from a deep generative model after it has been trained is still an under-explored problem. To obtain samples from a pretrained generative model, most existing generative human motion prediction methods draw a set of independent Gaussian latent codes and convert them to motion samples. Clearly, this random sampling strategy is not guaranteed to produce diverse samples for two reasons: (1) The independent sampling cannot force the samples to be diverse; (2) The sampling is based solely on likelihood which may only produce samples that correspond to the major modes of the data distribution. To address these problems, we propose a novel sampling method, Diversifying Latent Flows (DLow), to produce a diverse set of samples from a pretrained deep generative model. Unlike random (independent) sampling, the proposed DLow sampling method samples a single random variable and then maps it with a set of learnable mapping functions to a set of correlated latent codes. The correlated latent codes are then decoded into a set of correlated samples. During training, DLow uses a diversity-promoting prior over samples as an objective to optimize the latent mappings to improve sample diversity. The design of the prior is highly flexible and can be customized to generate diverse motions with common features (e.g., similar leg motion but diverse upper-body motion). Our experiments demonstrate that DLow outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of sample diversity and accuracy.",

To solve this problem, we introduce 3D grids as intermediate representations to regularize unordered point clouds. We therefore propose a novel Gridding Residual Network (GRNet) for point cloud completion. In particular, we devise two novel differentiable layers, named Gridding and Gridding Reverse, to convert between point clouds and 3D grids without losing structural information.

A key challenge for gait recognition is to learn representations from the silhouettes that are invariant to the factors such as clothing, carrying conditions and camera viewpoints. Besides being discriminative for identification, the gait representations should also be compact for storage to keep millions of subjects registered in the gallery. In this work, we propose a novel network named Gait Lateral Network (GLN) which can learn both discriminative and compact representations from the silhouettes for gait recognition. Specifically, GLN leverages the inherent feature pyramid in deep convolutional neural networks to enhance the gait representations. The silhouette-level and set-level features extracted by different stages are merged with the lateral connections in a top-down manner. Besides, GLN is equipped with a Compact Block which can significantly reduce the dimension of the gait representations without hindering the accuracy. Extensive experiments on CASIA-B and OUMVLP show that GLN can achieve state-of-the-art performance using the $256$-dimensional representations. Under the most challenging condition of walking in different clothes on CASIA-B, our method improves the rank-1 accuracy by $6.45\\%$.",

		"abstract": "Recent reference-based face restoration methods have received considerable attention due to their great capability in recovering high-frequency details on real low-quality images. However, most of these methods require a high-quality reference image of the same identity, making them only applicable in limited scenes. To address this issue, this paper suggests a deep face dictionary network (termed as DFDNet) to guide the restoration process of degraded observations. To begin with, we use K-means to generate deep dictionaries for perceptually significant face components (i.e., left/right eyes, nose and mouth) from high-quality images. Next, with the degraded input, we match and select the most similar component features from their corresponding dictionaries and transfer the high-quality details to the input via the proposed dictionary feature transfer (DFT) block. In particular, component AdaIN is leveraged to eliminate the style diversity between the input and dictionary features (e.g., illumination), and a confidence score is proposed to adaptively fuse the dictionary feature to the input. Finally, multi-scale dictionaries are adopted in a progressive manner to enable the coarse-to-fine restoration. Experiments show that our proposed method can achieve plausible performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and more importantly, can generate realistic and promising results on real degraded images without requiring an identity-belonging reference.

The resulting shape, however, is a plausible face only when the basis coefficients take values within limited intervals. Methods based on unconstrained optimization address this issue with a weighted $\u001bll_2$ penalty on coefficients; however, determining the weight of this penalty is difficult, and the existence of a unique weight that works universally is questionable. We propose a new formulation that does not require the tuning of any weight parameter. Specifically, we formulate 3DMM fitting as an inequality-constrained optimization problem, where the primary constraint is that basis coefficients should not exceed the interval that is learned when the 3DMM is constructed. We employ additional constraints to exploit sparse landmark detectors by enforcing the facial shape to be within the error bounds of a reliable detector. To enable operation ``in-the-wild'', we use a robust objective function, namely gradient correlation. Our approach performs comparably with deep learning (DL) methods on ``in-the-wild'' data, which have inexact ground truth, and better than DL methods on more controlled data with exact ground truth. Since our formulation does not require any learning, it enjoys a versatility that allows it to operate with multiple frames of arbitrary sizes.

To guarantee its positive definiteness, we perform spectral decomposition on the kernel matrix and re-parameterize it via the Cayley representation.

However, the effectiveness of such intelligent functionality requires in-situ continuous model adaptation for adapting to new data and environments, while the on-device computing and energy resources are usually extremely constrained. Neither traditional hand-crafted (e.g., SGD, Adagrad, and Adam) nor existing meta optimizers are specifically designed to meet those challenges, as the former requires tedious hyper-parameter tuning while the latter are often costly due to the meta algorithms’ own overhead. To this end, we propose hardware-aware learning to optimize (HALO), a practical meta optimizer dedicated to resource-efficient on-device adaptation. Our HALO optimizer features the following highlights: (1) faster adaptation speed (i.e., taking fewer data or iterations to reach a specified accuracy) by introducing a new regularizer to promote empirical generalization; and (2) lower per-iteration complexity, thanks to a stochastic structural sparsity regularizer being enforced. Furthermore, the optimizer itself is designed as a very light-weight RNN and thus incurs negligible overhead. Ablation studies and experiments on five datasets, six optimizees, and two state-of-the-art (SOTA) edge AI devices validate that, while always achieving a better accuracy (↑0.46% - ↑20.28%), HALO can greatly trim down the energy cost (up to ↓60%) in adaptation, quantified using an IoT device or SOTA simulator.

		"title": "Knowledge Distillation Meets Self-Supervision",
		"abstract": "Knowledge distillation, which involves extracting the \"\"dark knowledge\"\" from a teacher network to guide the learning of a student network, has emerged as an important technique for model compression and transfer learning. Unlike previous works that exploit architecture-specific cues such as activation and attention for distillation, here we wish to explore a more general and model-agnostic approach for extracting \"\"richer dark knowledge\"\" from the pre-trained teacher model. We show that the seemingly different self-supervision task can serve as a simple yet powerful solution. For example, when performing contrastive learning between transformed entities, the noisy predictions of the teacher network reflect its intrinsic composition of semantic and pose information. By exploiting the similarity between those self-supervision signals as an auxiliary task, one can effectively transfer the hidden information from the teacher to the student. In this paper, we discuss practical ways to exploit those noisy self-supervision signals with selective transfer for distillation. We further show that self-supervision signals improve conventional distillation with substantial gains under few-shot and noisy-label scenarios. Given the richer knowledge mined from self-supervision, our knowledge distillation approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100 and ImageNet, under both similar-architecture and cross-architecture settings. The advantage is even more pronounced under the cross-architecture setting, where our method outperforms the state of the art CRD by an average of 2.3% in accuracy rate on CIFAR100 across six different teacher-student pairs.",

We adopt the recent Neighbourhood Consensus Networks that have demonstrated promising performance for difficult correspondence problems and propose modifications to overcome their main limitations: large memory consumption, large inference time and poorly localised correspondences. Our proposed modifications can reduce the memory footprint and execution time more than $10 imes$, with equivalent results. This is achieved by sparsifying the correlation tensor containing tentative matches, and its subsequent processing with a 4D CNN using submanifold sparse convolutions. Localisation accuracy is significantly improved by processing the input images in higher resolution, which is possible due to the reduced memory footprint, and by a novel two-stage correspondence relocalisation module. The proposed Sparse-NCNet method obtains state-of-the art results on the HPatches Sequences and InLoc visual localisation benchmarks, and competitive results on the Aachen Day-Night benchmark.",

		"title": "Reconstructing the Noise Variance Manifold for Image Denoising",
		"abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully used in many low-level vision problems like image denoising. Although the conditional image generation techniques have led to large improvements in this task, there has been little effort in providing conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) with an explicit way of understanding the image noise for object-independent denoising reliable for real-world applications. The task of leveraging structures in the target space is unstable due to the complexity of patterns in natural scenes, so the presence of unnatural artifacts or over-smoothed image areas cannot be avoided. To fill the gap, in this work we introduce the idea of a cGAN which explicitly leverages structure in the image noise variance space. By learning directly a low dimensional manifold of the image noise variance, the generator promotes the removal from the noisy image only that information which spans this manifold. This idea brings many advantages while it can be appended at the end of any denoiser to significantly improve its performance. Based on our experiments, our model substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art architectures, resulting in denoised images with less oversmoothing and better detail.",

		"title": "Occlusion-Aware Depth Estimation with Adaptive Normal Constraints",
		"abstract": "We present a new learning-based method for multi-frame depth estimation from a color video, which is a fundamental problem in scene understanding, robot navigation or handheld 3D reconstruction. While recent learning-based methods estimate depth at high accuracy, 3D point clouds exported from their depth maps often fail to preserve important geometric feature (e.g., corners, edges, planes) of man-made scenes. Widely-used pixel-wise depth errors do not specifically penalize inconsistency on these features. These inaccuracies are particularly severe when subsequent depth reconstructions are accumulated in an attempt to scan a full environment with man-made objects with this kind of features. Our depth estimation algorithm therefore introduces a Combined Normal Map (CNM) constraint, which is designed to better preserve high-curvature features and global planar regions. In order to further improve the depth estimation accuracy, we introduce a new occlusion-aware strategy that aggregates initial depth predictions from multiple adjacent views into one final depth map and occlusion probability map for the current reference view. With the CNM constraint and the occlusion-aware loss, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of depth estimation accuracy, and preserves essential geometric features of man-made indoor scenes much better than other algorithms.",

We also present an analysis for why directly optimising the ranking based metric of AP offers benefits over other deep metric learning losses. We apply Smooth-AP to standard retrieval benchmarks: Stanford Online products and VehicleID, and also evaluate on larger-scale datasets: INaturalist for fine-grained category retrieval, and VGGFace2 and IJB-C for face retrieval.

		"abstract": "Supervised learning in large discriminative models is a mainstay for modern computer vision. Such an approach necessitates investing in large-scale human-annotated datasets for achieving state-of-the-art results. In turn, the efficacy of supervised learning may be limited by the size of the human annotated dataset. This limitation is particularly notable for image segmentation tasks, where the expense of human annotation is especially large, yet large amounts of unlabeled data may exist. In this work, we ask if we may leverage semi-supervised learning in unlabeled video sequences and extra images to improve the performance on urban scene segmentation, simultaneously tackling semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. The goal of this work is to avoid the construction of sophisticated, learned architectures specific to label propagation (e.g., patch matching and optical flow). Instead, we simply predict pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and train subsequent models with both human-annotated and pseudo-labeled data. The procedure is iterated for several times. As a result, our Naive-Student model, trained with such simple yet effective iterative semi-supervised learning, attains state-of-the-art results at all three Cityscapes benchmarks, reaching the performance of 67.8% PQ, 42.6% AP, and 85.2% mIOU on the test set.

In contrast, we propose a novel spatially aware self-attention layer such that each visual entity only looks at neighboring entities defined by a spatial graph. Further, each head in our multi-head self-attention layer focuses on a different subset of relations. Our approach has two advantages: (1) each head considers local context instead of dispersing the attention amongst all visual entities; (2) we avoid learning redundant features. We show that our model improves the absolute accuracy of current state-of-the-art methods on TextVQA by 2.2% overall over an improved baseline, and 4.62% on questions that involve spatial reasoning and can be answered correctly using OCR tokens.

To further boost the robustness and completeness of 3D point cloud reconstruction, we extend VA-MVSNet with pyramid multi-scale images input as PVA-MVSNet, where multi-metric constraints are leveraged to aggregate the reliable depth estimation at the coarser scale to fill in the mismatched regions at the finer scale.

		"title": "Monocular Expressive Body Regression through Body-Driven Attention",
		"abstract": "To understand how people look, interact, or perform tasks, we need to quickly and accurately capture their 3D body, face, and hands together from an RGB image. Most existing methods focus only on parts of the body. A few recent approaches reconstruct full expressive 3D humans from images using 3D body models that include the face and hands. These methods are optimization-based and thus slow, prone to local optima, and require 2D keypoints as input. We address these limitations by introducing ExPose (EXpressive POse and Shape rEgression), which directly regresses the body, face, and hands, in SMPL-X format, from an RGB image. This is a hard problem due to the high dimensionality of the body and the lack of expressive training data. Additionally, hands and faces are much smaller than the body, occupying very few image pixels. This makes hand and face estimation hard when body images are downscaled for neural networks. We make three main contributions. First, we account for the lack of training data by curating a dataset of SMPL-X fits on in-the-wild images. Second, we observe that body estimation localizes the face and hands reasonably well. We introduce body-driven attention for face and hand regions in the original image to extract higher-resolution crops that are fed to dedicated refinement modules. Third, these modules exploit part-specific knowledge from existing face and hand-only datasets. ExPose estimates expressive 3D humans more accurately than existing optimization methods at a small fraction of the computational cost.

The success of deep neural network in denoising stimulates the research of noise generation, aiming at synthesizing more pairs of clean-noisy images to facilitate the training of deep. In this work, we propose a novel unified framework to simultaneously deal with the noise removal and noise generation tasks. Instead of only inferring the posterior distribution of the latent clean image conditioned on the observed noisy image in traditional MAP framework, it learns the joint distribution of the clean-noisy image pairs. Specifically, we approximate the joint distribution with two different factorized forms, which can be formulated as a denoiser mapping the noisy image to the clean one and a generator mapping the clean to the noisy one. The learned joint distribution implicitly contains all the information between the noisy and clean images, avoiding the necessity of manually designing the image priors and noise assumptions as traditional. Besides, the performance of our denoiser can be further improved by augmenting the original training dataset with the learned generator. Moreover, we propose two metrics to assess the quality of the generated noisy image, for which, to the best of our knowledge, such metrics are first proposed along this research line.

DP sensors are used to assist a camera's auto-focus by capturing two sub-aperture views of the scene in a single image shot. The two sub-aperture images are used to calculate the appropriate lens position to focus on a particular scene region and are discarded afterwards. We introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture that uses these discarded sub-aperture images to reduce defocus blur. A key contribution of our effort is a carefully captured dataset of 500 scenes (2000 images) where each scene has: (i) an image with defocus blur captured at a large aperture; (ii) the two associated DP sub-aperture views; and (iii) the corresponding all-in-focus image captured with a small aperture.

This fact brings about two main difficulties: excessive/varying length and complex video dynamic/rhythm. To address this, we propose Rhythmic RNN (RhyRNN) which is capable of handling long video sequences (up to 3,000 frames) as well as capturing rhythms at different scales.

Inspired by scale weighing, we propose a novel ‘counting scale’ termed LibraNet where the count value is analogized by weight. By virtually placing a crowd image on one side of a scale, LibraNet (agent) sequentially learns to place appropriate weights on the other side to match the crowd count. At each step, LibraNet chooses one weight (action) from the weight box (the pre-defined action pool) according to the current crowd image features and weights placed on the scale pan (state).

A backdoor attack installs a backdoor into the victim model by injecting a backdoor pattern into a small set of training examples. The victim model behaves normally on clean test data, yet consistently predicts a specific (likely incorrect) target class whenever the backdoor pattern is present in an input example. While existing backdoor attacks are effective, they are not stealthy. The modifications made on training data or labels are often suspicious and can be easily detected by simple data filtering or human inspection. In this paper, we present a new type of backdoor attack inspired by an important natural phenomenon: reflection. Using mathematical modeling of physical reflection models, we propose reflection backdoor (Refool) to plant reflections as backdoor into a victim model. We demonstrate on 3 computer vision tasks and 5 datasets that, Refool can attack state-of-the-art DNNs with high success rate, and is more resistant to state-of-the-art backdoor defenses than existing attacks.",

		"abstract": "Domain generalization models learn to generalize to previously unseen domains, but suffer from prediction uncertainty and domain shift. In this paper, we address both problems. We introduce a probabilistic meta-learning model for domain generalization, in which classifier parameters shared across domains are modeled as distributions. This enables better handling of prediction uncertainty on unseen domains. To deal with domain shift, we learn domain-invariant representations by the proposed principle of meta variational information bottleneck, we call MetaVIB. MetaVIB is derived from novel variational bounds of mutual information, by leveraging the meta-learning setting of domain generalization. Through episodic training, MetaVIB learns to gradually narrow domain gaps to establish domain-invariant representations, while simultaneously maximizing prediction accuracy. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks for cross-domain visual recognition. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the benefits of MetaVIB for domain generalization. The comparison results demonstrate our method outperforms previous approaches consistently.",

The task of unsupervised image classification remains an important, and open challenge in computer vision. Several recent approaches have tried to tackle this problem in an end-to-end fashion.

First, a self-supervised task from representation learning is employed to obtain semantically meaningful features. Second, we use the obtained features as a prior in a learnable clustering approach. In doing so, we remove the ability for cluster learning to depend on low-level features, which is present in current end-to-end learning approaches. Experimental evaluation shows that we outperform state-of-the-art methods by large margins, in particular +26.6% on CIFAR10, +25.0% on CIFAR100-20 and +21.3% on STL10 in terms of classification accuracy.

		"abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is unique in that it requires turning relatively general natural-language instructions into robot agent actions, on the basis of visible environments. This requires to extract value from two very different types of natural-language information. The first is object description (e.g., `table', `door'), each presenting as a tip for the agent to determine the next action by finding the item visible in the environment, and the second is action specification (e.g., `go straight', `turn left') which allows the robot to directly predict the next movements without relying on visual perceptions. However, most existing methods pay few attention to distinguish these information from each other during instruction encoding and mix together the matching between textual object/action encoding and visual perception/orientation features of candidate viewpoints. In this paper, we propose an Object-and-Action Aware Model (OAAM) that processes these two different forms of natural language based instruction separately. This enables each process to match object-centered/action-centered instruction to their own counterpart visual perception/action orientation flexibly. However, one side-issue caused by above solution is that an object mentioned in instructions may be observed in the direction of two or more candidate viewpoints, thus the OAAM may not predict the viewpoint on the shortest path as the next action. To handle this problem, we design a simple but effective path loss to penalize trajectories deviating from the ground truth path. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and path loss, and the superiority of their combination with a 50% SPL score on the R2R dataset and a 40% CLS score on the R4R dataset in unseen environments, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art.",

The objective of this paper is to have a comprehensive and systematic study of weight sharing in GCNs for 3D HPE.

First, optical flow is often used to establish one-on-one temporal correspondences. But flow estimation itself is error-prone and hence largely affects the ultimate recovery result. Second, similar patterns existing in natural images are rarely exploited for the VSR task. Motivated by these findings, we propose a temporal multi-correspondence aggregation strategy to leverage most similar patches across frames, and also a cross-scale nonlocal-correspondence aggregation scheme to explore self-similarity of images across scales.

Thus no computation overhead is introduced for inference. Compact models are employed for real-time execution. To narrow the performance gap between compact models and large models, new temporal knowledge distillation methods are designed.

While previous works addressed the task of robust prediction in the context of full-image classification, we consider it for dense semantic segmentation. We build upon an insight from image classification that output robustness can be improved by increasing the network-bias towards object shapes. We present a new training schema that increases this shape bias. Our basic idea is to alpha-blend a portion of the RGB training images with faked images, where each class-label is given a fixed, randomly chosen color that is not likely to appear in real imagery. This forces the network to rely more strongly on shape cues. We call this data augmentation technique \"\"Painting-by-Numbers''. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our training schema for DeepLabv3$+$ with various network backbones, MobileNet-V2, ResNets, and Xception, and evaluate it on the Cityscapes dataset. With respect to our 16 different types of image corruptions and 5 different network backbones, we are in 74% better than training with clean data. For cases where we are worse than a model trained without our training schema, it is mostly only marginally worse. However, for some image corruptions such as images with noise, we see a considerable performance gain of up to 25%.",

However, this has come at the cost of accuracy loss and higher inference latency due to lack of a notion of time. In this work, we propose an ANN to SNN conversion methodology that uses a time-based coding scheme, named Temporal-Switch-Coding (TSC), and a corresponding TSC spiking neuron model. Each input image pixel is presented using two spikes and the timing between the two spiking instants is proportional to the pixel intensity. The real-valued ReLU activations in ANN are encoded using the spike-times of the TSC neurons in the converted TSC-SNN. At most two memory accesses and two addition operations are performed for each synapse during the whole inference, which significantly improves the SNN energy efficiency.

A novel self-supervision training objective is proposed to enhance the model training consistency and stability. Second, by rethinking the relationship between defocus blur detection and salience detection, we identify two previously ignored but common scenarios, based on which we design a hard mining strategy to enhance the DBD model.

		"abstract": "This paper proposes new ways of sample mixing by thinking of the process as generation of barycenter in a metric space for data augmentation. First, we present an optimal-transport-based mixup technique to generate Wasserstein barycenter which works well on images with clean background and is empirically shown complementary to existing mixup methods. Then we generalize mixup to an AutoMix technique by using a learnable network to fit barycenter in a cooperative way between the classifier (a.k.a. discriminator) and generator networks. Experimental results on both multi-class and multi-label prediction tasks show the efficacy of our approach, which is also verified in the presence of unseen categories (open set) and noise.",

		"title": "Scene Text Image Super-resolution in the wild",
		"abstract": "Low-resolution text images are often seen in natural scenes such as documents captured by mobile phones. Recognizing low-resolution text images is challenging because they lose detailed content information, leading to poor recognition accuracy. An intuitive solution is to introduce super-resolution (SR) techniques as pre-processing. However, previous single image super-resolution (SISR) methods are trained on synthetic low resolution images (e.g.Bicubic down-sampling), which is simple and not suitable for real low-resolution text recognition. To this end, we propose a real scene text SR dataset, termed TextZoom. It contains paired real low-resolution and high-resolution images which are captured by cameras with different focal length in the wild. It is more authentic and challenging than synthetic data, as shown in Fig. 1. We argue improving the recognition accuracy is the ultimate goal for SceneText SR. In this purpose, a new Text Super-Resolution Network, termed TSRN, with three novel modules is developed. (1) A sequential residual block is proposed to extract the sequential information of the text images. (2) A boundary-aware loss is designed to sharpen the character boundaries.(3) A central alignment module is proposed to relieve the misalignment problem in TextZoom. Extensive experiments on TextZoom demonstrate that our TSRN largely improves the recognition accuracy by over 13%of CRNN, and by nearly 9.0% of ASTER and MORAN compared to synthetic SR data. Furthermore, our TSRN clearly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art SR methods in boosting the recognition accuracy of LR images in TextZoom. For example, it outperforms LapSRN by over 5% and 8%on the recognition accuracy of ASTER and CRNN. Our results suggest that low-resolution text recognition in the wild is far from being solved, thus more research effort is needed",

We make these two representations synergistic by introducing novel consistency losses that ensure that the surface created from the atlas aligns with the level-set of the implicit function. Our hybrid architecture outputs results which are superior to the output of the two equivalent single-representation networks, yielding smoother explicit surfaces with more accurate normals, and a more accurate implicit occupancy function. Additionally, our surface reconstruction step can directly leverage the explicit atlas-based representation. This process is computationally efficient, and can be directly used by differentiable rasterizers, enabling training our hybrid representation with image-based losses.",

		"title": "Learning Disentangled Representations with Latent Variation Predictability",
		"abstract": "Latent traversal is a popular approach to visualize the disentangled latent representations. Given a bunch of variations in a single unit of the latent representation, it is expected that there is a change in a single factor of variation of the data while others are fixed. However, this impressive experimental observation is rarely explicitly encoded in the objective function of learning disentangled representations. This paper defines the variation predictability of latent disentangled representations. Given image pairs generated by latent codes varying in a single dimension, this varied dimension could be closely correlated with these image pairs if the representation is well disentangled. Within an adversarial generation process, we encourage variation predictability by maximizing the mutual information between latent variations and corresponding image pairs. We further develop an evaluation metric that does not rely on the ground-truth generative factors to measure the disentanglement of latent representations. The proposed variation predictability is a general constraint that is applicable to the VAE and GAN frameworks for boosting disentanglement of latent representations. Experiments show that the proposed variation predictability correlates well with existing ground-truth-required metrics and the proposed algorithm is effective for disentanglement learning.",

One solution for this is to run VSR and FI, one by one, independently. This is highly inefficient as heavy deep neural networks (DNN) are involved in each solution. To this end, we propose an end-to-end DNN framework for the space-time video upsampling by efficiently merging VSR and FI into a joint framework.

Therefore, it uses constant memory regardless of the video length and costs substantially less memory and computation.

To address these issues, we propose a learning framework Subject Guidance Network (SGNet) for shot type recognition.

A potential drawback of using pseudo labels is that errors may accumulate and it is challenging to estimate the number of pseudo IDs. We introduce a different unsupervised method that allows us to learn pedestrian embeddings from raw videos, without resorting to pseudo labels. The goal is to construct a self-supervised pretext task that matches the person re-ID objective. Inspired by the \u001bmph{data association} concept in multi-object tracking, we propose the extbf{Cyc}le extbf{As}sociation ( extbf{CycAs}) task: after performing data association between a pair of video frames forward and then backward, a pedestrian instance is supposed to be associated to itself. To fulfill this goal, the model must learn a meaningful representation that can well describe correspondences between instances in frame pairs. We adapt the discrete association process to a differentiable form, such that end-to-end training becomes feasible. Experiments are conducted in two aspects: We first compare our method with existing unsupervised re-ID methods on seven benchmarks and demonstrate CycAs' superiority. Then, to further validate the practical value of CycAs in real-world applications, we perform training on self-collected videos and report promising performance on the standard test sets.",

		"title": "Towards Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking",
		"abstract": "Modern multiple object tracking (MOT) systems usually follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm. It has 1) a detection model for target localization and 2) an appearance embedding model for data association. Having the two models separately executed might lead to efficiency problems, as the running time is simply a sum of the two steps without investigating potential structures that can be shared between them. Existing research efforts on real-time MOT usually focus on the association step, so they are essentially real-time association methods but not real-time MOT system. In this paper, we propose an MOT system that allows target detection and appearance embedding to be learned in a shared model. Specifically, we incorporate the appearance embedding model into a single-shot detector, such that the model can simultaneously output detections and the corresponding embeddings. We further propose a simple and fast association method that works in conjunction with the joint model. In both components the computation cost is significantly reduced compared with former MOT systems, resulting in a neat and fast baseline for future follow-ups on real-time MOT algorithm design. To our knowledge, this work reports the first (near) real-time MOT system, with a running speed of 22 to 40 FPS depending on the input resolution.

		"title": "A Balanced and Uncertainty-aware Approach for Partial Domain Adaptation",
		"abstract": "This work addresses the unsupervised domain adaptation problem, especially in the case of class labels in the target domain being only a subset of those in the source domain. Such a partial transfer setting is realistic but challenging and existing methods always suffer from two key problems, negative transfer and uncertainty propagation. In this paper, we build on domain adversarial learning and propose a novel domain adaptation method BA$^3$US with two new techniques termed Balanced Adversarial Alignment (BAA) and Adaptive Uncertainty Suppression (AUS), respectively. On one hand, negative transfer results in misclassification of target samples to the classes only present in the source domain. To address this issue, BAA pursues the balance between label distributions across domains in a fairly simple manner. Specifically, it randomly leverages a few source samples to augment the smaller target domain during domain alignment so that classes in different domains are symmetric. On the other hand, a source sample would be denoted as uncertain if there is an incorrect class that has a relatively high prediction score, and such uncertainty easily propagates to unlabeled target data around it during alignment, which severely deteriorates adaptation performance. Thus we present AUS that emphasizes uncertain samples and exploits an adaptive weighted complement entropy objective to encourage incorrect classes to have uniform and low prediction scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our BA$^3$US surpasses state-of-the-arts for partial domain adaptation tasks. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/tim-learn/BA3US}.",

		"abstract": "Existing approaches for unsupervised metric learning focus on exploring self-supervision information within the input image itself. We observe that, when analyzing images, human eyes often compare images against each other instead of examining images individually. In addition, they often pay attention to certain keypoints, image regions, or objects which are discriminative between image classes but highly consistent within classes. Even if the image is being transformed, the attention pattern will be consistent. Motivated by this observation, we develop a new approach to unsupervised deep metric learning where the network is learned based on self-supervision information across images instead of within one single image. To characterize the consistent pattern of human attention during image comparisons, we introduce the idea of transformed attention consistency. It assumes that visually similar images, even undergoing different image transforms, should share the same consistent visual attention map. This consistency leads to a pairwise self-supervision loss, allowing us to learn a Siamese deep neural network to encode and compare images against their transformed or matched pairs. To further enhance the inter-class discriminative power of the feature generated by this network, we adapt the concept of triplet loss from supervised metric learning to our unsupervised case and introduce the contrastive clustering loss.

		"title": "Diverse and Admissible Trajectory Prediction through Multimodal Context Understanding",
		"abstract": "Multi-agent trajectory forecasting in autonomous driving requires an agent to accurately anticipate the behaviors of the surrounding vehicles and pedestrians, for safe and reliable decision-making. Due to partial observability in these dynamical scenes, directly obtaining the posterior distribution over future agent trajectories remains a challenging problem. In realistic embodied environments, each agent's future trajectories should be both diverse since multiple plausible sequences of actions can be used to reach its intended goals, and admissible since they must obey physical constraints and stay in drivable areas. In this paper, we propose a model that synthesizes multiple input signals from the multimodal world|the environment's scene context and interactions between multiple surrounding agents|to best model all diverse and admissible trajectories. We compare our model with strong baselines and ablations across two public datasets and show a significant performance improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we offer new metrics incorporating admissibility criteria to further study and evaluate the diversity of predictions. Codes are at: https://github.com/kami93/CMU-DATF",

If this new technology is to find practical uses, we need to achieve a level of control over generative networks which, without sacrificing realism, is on par with that seen in computer graphics and character animation. To this end we propose ConfigNet, a neural face model that allows for controlling individual aspects of output images in semantically meaningful ways and that is a significant step on the path towards finely-controllable neural rendering. ConfigNet is trained on real face images as well as synthetic face renders. Our novel method uses synthetic data to factorize the latent space into elements that correspond to the inputs of a traditional rendering pipeline, separating aspects such as head pose, facial expression, hair style, illumination, and many others which are very hard to annotate in real data. The real images, which are presented to the network without labels, extend the variety of the generated images and encourage realism. Finally, we propose an evaluation criterion using an attribute detection network combined with a user study and demonstrate state-of-the-art individual control over attributes in the output images.",

In this work, we present the Conditional Domain Normalization (CDN) to bridge the domain distribution gap. CDN is designed to encode different domain inputs into a shared latent space, where the features from different domains carry the same domain attribute. To achieve this, we first disentangle the domain-specific attribute out of the semantic features from source domain via a domain embedding module, which learns a domain-vector to characterize the domain attribute information. Then this domain-vector is used to encode the features from target domain through a conditional normalization, resulting in different domains' features carrying the same domain attribute. We incorporate CDN into various convolution stages of an object detector to adaptively address the domain shifts of different level's representation. In contrast to existing adaptation works that conduct domain confusion learning on semantic features to remove domain-specific factors, CDN aligns different domain distributions by modulating the semantic features of target domains conditioned on the learned domain-vector of the source domain. Extensive experiments show that CDN outperforms existing methods remarkably on both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation benchmarks, including 2D image detection and 3D point cloud detection.",

However, without transfer learning, the learned model is fixed as is, which is not adaptable for handling various unseen scenarios. In this paper, beyond representation learning, we consider how to formulate person image matching directly in deep feature maps. We treat image matching as finding local correspondences in feature maps, and construct query-adaptive convolution kernels on the fly to achieve local matching. In this way, the matching process and results are interpretable, and this explicit matching is more generalizable than representation features to unseen scenarios, such as unknown misalignments, pose or viewpoint changes. To facilitate end-to-end training of this architecture, we further build a class memory module to cache feature maps of the most recent samples of each class, so as to compute image matching losses for metric learning. Through direct cross-dataset evaluation, the proposed Query-Adaptive Convolution (QAConv) method gains large improvements over popular learning methods (about 10%+ mAP), and achieves comparable results to many transfer learning methods.

The relationship between guided points is explored by the graph pose refinement module to get more accurate localization results.

With that in mind, we propose a multi-teacher-single-student (MTSS) approach inspired by the multi-task learning and the distillation of semi-supervised learning.

To depress noises in pseudo-labels, this paper proposes a Noise Resistible Mutual-Training (NRMT) method, which maintains two networks during training to perform collaborative clustering and mutual instance selection. On one hand, collaborative clustering eases the fitting to noisy instances by allowing the two networks to use pseudo-labels provided by each other as an additional supervision.

Most existing works simply assume that depth measurements are accurate and well-aligned with the RGB pixels and models the problem as a cross-modal feature fusion to obtain better feature representations to achieve more accurate segmentation. This, however, may not lead to satisfactory results as actual depth data are generally noisy, which might worsen the accuracy as the networks go deeper.  In this paper, we propose a unified and efficient Cross-modality Guided Encoder to not only effectively recalibrate RGB feature responses, but also to distill accurate depth information via multiple stages and aggregate the two recalibrated representations alternatively. The key of the proposed architecture is a novel Separation-and-Aggregation Gating operation that jointly filters and recalibrates both representations before cross-modality aggregation. Meanwhile, a Bi-direction Multi-step Propagation strategy is introduced, on the one hand, to help to propagate and fuse information between the two modalities, and on the other hand, to preserve their specificity along the long-term propagation process. Besides, our proposed encoder can be easily injected into the previous encoder-decoder structures to boost their performance on RGB-D semantic segmentation.

To tackle these problems, we propose Mask TextSpotter v3, an end-to-end trainable scene text spotter that adopts a Segmentation Proposal Network (SPN) instead of an RPN. Our SPN is anchor-free and gives accurate representations of arbitrary-shape proposals. It is therefore superior to RPN in detecting text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular shapes. Furthermore, the accurate proposals produced by SPN allow masked RoI features to be used for decoupling neighboring text instances. As a result, our Mask TextSpotter v3 can handle text instances of extreme aspect ratios or irregular shapes, and its recognition accuracy won't be affected by nearby text or background noise. Specifically, we outperform state-of-the-art methods by 21.9 percent on the Rotated ICDAR 2013 dataset (rotation robustness), 5.9 percent on the Total-Text dataset (shape robustness), and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MSRA-TD500 dataset (aspect ratio robustness).

		"title": "Making Affine Correspondences Work in Camera Geometry Computation",
		"abstract": "Local features such as SIFT and its affine and learned variants provide region-to-region rather than point-to-point correspondences. It has recently been exploited to create new minimal solvers for classical problems such as homography, essential and fundamental matrix estimation. The main argument in favor of such solvers is that their minimal sample size is smaller, e.g., only two instead of four matches are required to estimate a homography. Works proposing such solvers often claim a significant improvement in run-time thanks to fewer RANSAC iterations. We show that this argument is not valid in practice if the solvers are used naively as noise in the local feature geometries often causes RANSAC to fail to find an accurate solution. To overcome this, we propose guidelines for effective use of region-to-region matches in the course of a full model estimation pipeline. We propose a method for refining the local feature geometries by symmetric intensity-based matching, combine uncertainty propagation inside RANSAC with preemptive model verification, show a general scheme for computing uncertainty of minimal solvers results, and adapt the sample cheirality check for homography estimation to region-to-region correspondences. Our experiments show that affine solvers can achieve accuracy comparable to point-based solvers at faster run-times when following our guidelines.",

		"abstract": "Margin-based deep face recognition methods (e.g. SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace) have achieved remarkable success in unconstrained face recognition. However, these methods are susceptible to the massive label noise in the training data and thus require laborious human effort to clean the datasets. In this paper, we relax the intra-class constraint of ArcFace to improve the robustness to label noise. More specifically, we design $K$ sub-centers for each class and the training sample only needs to be close to any of the $K$ positive sub-centers instead of the only one positive center. The proposed sub-center ArcFace encourages one dominant sub-class that contains the majority of clean faces and non-dominant sub-classes that include hard or noisy faces. Extensive experiments confirm the robustness of sub-center ArcFace under massive real-world noise. After the model achieves enough discriminative power, we directly drop non-dominant sub-centers and high-confident noisy samples, which helps recapture intra-compactness, decrease the influence from noise, and achieve comparable performance compared to ArcFace trained on the manually cleaned dataset. By taking advantage of the large-scale raw web faces (Celeb500K), sub-center Arcface achieves state-of-the-art performance on IJB-B, IJB-C, MegaFace, and FRVT.",

We study this hypothesis under the framework of multiview contrastive learning, where we learn a representation that aims to maximize mutual information between different views of the same scene but is otherwise compact. Our approach scales to any number of views, and is view-agnostic. We analyze key properties of the approach that make it work, finding that the contrastive loss outperforms a popular alternative based on cross-view prediction, and that the more views we learn from, the better the resulting representation captures underlying scene semantics.",

In particular, we show that a simple universal perturbation can fool a series of state-of-the-art defenses.Adversarial examples generated by existing attacks are generally hard to transfer to defense models. We observe the property of regional homogeneity in adversarial perturbations and suggest that the defenses are less robust to regionally homogeneous perturbations. Therefore, we propose an effective transforming paradigm and a customized gradient transformer module to transform existing perturbations into regionally homogeneous ones. Without explicitly forcing the perturbations to be universal, we observe that a well-trained gradient transformer module tends to output input-independent gradients (hence universal) benefiting from the under-fitting phenomenon. Thorough experiments demonstrate that our work significantly outperforms the prior art attacking algorithms (either image-dependent or universal ones) by an average improvement of 14.0% when attacking 9 defenses in the transfer-based attack setting. In addition to the cross-model transferability, we also verify that regionally homogeneous perturbations can well transfer across different vision tasks (attacking with the semantic segmentation task and testing on the object detection task).

Existingquantization methods require original data for calibration or fine-tuning to get better performance. However, in many real-world scenarios, the data may not be available due to confidential or private issues, thereby making existing quantization methods not applicable. Moreover, due to the absence of original data, the recently developed generative adversarial networks (GANs) cannot be applied to generate data. Although the full-precision model may contain rich data information, such information alone is hard to exploit for recovering the original data or generating new meaningful data. In this paper, we investigate a simple-yet-effective method called Generative Low-bitwidth Data Free Quantization(GDFQ) to remove the data dependence burden. Specifically, we propose a knowledge matching generator to produce meaningful fake data by exploiting classification boundary knowledge and distribution information in the pre-trained model. With the help of generated data, we can quantize a model by learning knowledge from the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments on three data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

To overcome this challenge, we propose to leverage the vastly available mono data to facilitate the generation of stereophonic audio. Our key observation is that the task of visually indicated audio separation also maps independent audios to their corresponding visual positions, which shares a similar objective with stereophonic audio generation. We integrate both stereo generation and source separation into a unified framework, Sep-Stereo, by considering source separation as a particular type of audio spatialization.

To introduce frequency into the face forgery detection, we propose a novel Frequency in Face Forgery Network (F$^3$-Net), taking advantages of two different but complementary frequency-aware clues, 1) frequency-aware decomposed image components, and 2) local frequency statistics, to deeply mine the forgery patterns via our two-stream collaborative learning framework.

In this paper, we attempt to not only consider the appearance of a hand but incorporate the temporal movement information of a hand in motion into the learning framework for better 3D hand pose estimation performance, which leads to the necessity of a large scale dataset with sequential RGB hand images. We propose a novel method that generates a synthetic dataset that mimics natural human hand movements by re-engineering annotations of an extant static hand pose dataset into pose-flows. With the generated dataset, we train a newly proposed recurrent framework, exploiting visuo-temporal features from sequential images of synthetic hands in motion and emphasizing temporal smoothness of estimations with a temporal consistency constraint. Our novel training strategy of detaching the recurrent layer of the framework during domain finetuning from synthetic to real allows preservation of the visuo-temporal features learned from sequential synthetic hand images. Hand poses that are sequentially estimated consequently produce natural and smooth hand movements which lead to more robust estimations. We show that utilizing temporal information for 3D hand pose estimation significantly enhances general pose estimations by outperforming state-of-the-art methods in experiments on hand pose estimation benchmarks.",

As one of the most popular normalization techniques, batch normalization (BN) has shown its eﬀectiveness in accelerating the model training speed and improving model generalization capability. The success of BN has been explained from diﬀerent views, such as reducing internal covariate shift, allowing the use of large learning rate, smoothing optimization landscape, etc. To make a deeper understanding of BN, in this work we prove that BN actually introduces a certain level of noise into the sample mean and variance during the training process, while the noise level depends only on the batch size. Such a noise generation mechanism of BN regularizes the training process, and we present an explicit regularizer formulation of BN. Since the regularization strength of BN is determined by the batch size, a small batch size may cause the under-ﬁtting problem, resulting in a less eﬀective model. To reduce the dependency of BN on batch size, we propose a momentum BN (MBN) scheme by averaging the mean and variance of current mini-batch with the historical means and variances. With a dynamic momentum parameter, we can automatically control the noise level in the training process. As a result, MBN works very well even when the batch size is very small (e.g., 2), which is hard to achieve by traditional BN.",

We aim to address the following problems in current 3D point cloud adversarial attacks: they do not transfer well between different networks, and they are easy to defend against via simple statistical methods. To this extent, we develop a new point cloud attack (dubbed AdvPC) that exploits the input data distribution by adding an adversarial loss, after Auto-Encoder reconstruction, to the objective it optimizes. AdvPC leads to perturbations that are resilient against current defenses, while remaining highly transferable compared to state-of-the-art attacks.

To this end, we propose to model and reason the region-wise relations by learning graph representations, and leverage the edge information between regions for optimized abstraction.

Furthermore, we incorporate the edge information to aggregate the pixel-wise features onto vertices, which emphasizes on the features around edges for fine segmentation along edges.

G-LBM selects the intrinsic dimensionality of the underling manifold of the observations, and its probabilistic nature models the noise in the observation data. G-LBM has direct application in the background scenes model estimation from video sequences and we have evaluated its performance on SBMnet-2016 and BMC2012 datasets, where it achieved a performance higher or comparable to other state-of-the-art methods while being agnostic to the background scenes in videos. Besides, in challenges such as camera jitter and background motion, G-LBM is able to robustly estimate the background by effectively modeling the uncertainties in video observations in these scenarios.",

		"abstract": "We introduce H3DNet, which takes a colorless 3D point cloud as input and outputs a collection of oriented object bounding boxes (or BB) and their semantic labels. The critical idea of H3DNet is to predict a hybrid set of geometric primitives, i.e., BB centers, BB face centers, and BB edge centers. We show how to convert the predicted geometric primitives into object proposals by defining a distance function between an object and the geometric primitives. This distance function enables continuous optimization of object proposals, and its local minimums provide high-fidelity object proposals. H3DNet then utilizes a matching and refinement module to classify object proposals into detected objects and fine-tune the geometric parameters of the detected objects. The hybrid set of geometric primitives not only provides more accurate signals for object detection than using a single type of geometric primitives, but it also provides an overcomplete set of constraints on the resulting 3D layout. Therefore, H3DNet can tolerate outliers in predicted geometric primitives. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on two large datasets with real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D.",

		"abstract": "VR telepresence consists of interacting with another human in a virtual space represented by an avatar. Today most avatars are cartoon-like, but soon the technology will allow video-realistic ones. This paper aims in this direction and presents Modular Codec Avatars (MCA), a method to generate hyper-realistic faces driven by the cameras in the VR headset. MCA extends traditional Codec Avatars (CA) by replacing the holistic models with a learned modular representation. It is important to note that traditional person-specific CAs are learned from few training samples, and typically lack robustness as well as limited expressiveness when transferring facial expressions. MCAs solve these issues by learning a modulated adaptive blending of different facial components as well as an exemplar-based latent alignment. We demonstrate that MCA achieves improved expressiveness and robustness w.r.t to CA in a variety of real-world datasets and practical scenarios. Finally, we showcase new applications in VR telepresence enabled by the proposed model.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of salient object detection for RGB-D images by using both color and depth information. A major technical challenge for detecting salient objects in RGB-D images is to fully leverage the two complementary data sources. The existing works either simply distill prior knowledge from the corresponding depth map to handle the RGB-image or blindly fuse color and geometric information to generate the depth-aware representations, hindering the performance of RGB-D saliency detectors. In this work, we introduce Cascade Graph Neural Networks (Cas-Gnn), a unified framework which is capable of comprehensively distilling and reasoning the mutual benefit between these two data sources through a set of cascade graphs, to learn powerful representations for RGB-D salient object detection. Cas-Gnn processes the two data sources separately and employs a novel Cascade Graph Reasoning (CGR) module to learn the powerful dense feature embeddings so that the saliency map can be easily inferred. Different from previous approaches, Cas-Gnn, by explicitly modeling and reasoning high-level relations between complementary data sources, can overcome many challenges like occlusions and ambiguities. Extensive experiments on several widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that CasGnn achieves significantly better performance than all existing RGB-D SOD approaches.",

An interesting topic is the study of mechanisms via which the de novo design or training of the model can be informed by fairness measures. Here, we study mechanisms that impose fairness concurrently while training the model. While existing fairness based approaches in vision have largely relied on training adversarial modules together with the primary classification/regression task, in an effort to remove the influence of the protected attribute or variable, we show how ideas based on well-known optimization concepts can provide a simpler alternative. In our proposed scheme, imposing fairness just requires specifying the protected attribute and utilizing our optimization routine.

This setting is particularly important for generalization in human activity video generation, obviating the need to observe every possible action-object combination in training and thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion involved in modeling complex scenes. To generate human-object interaction videos, we propose a novel adversarial framework HOI-GAN which includes multiple discriminators focusing on different aspects of a video.

To be concrete, our Visual-Textual Attribute Alignment model (dubbed as ViTAA) learns to disentangle the feature space of a person into sub-spaces corresponding to attributes using a light auxiliary attribute segmentation layer.

Given an RGB foggy nighttime image, our grayscale module takes the grayscale version of the image as input, and decomposes it into high and low frequency layers. The high frequency layer contains the scene texture information, which is less affected by fog; and, the low frequency layer contains the scene layout/structure information including fog and glow. Our grayscale module then enhances the visibility of the textures in the high frequency layers, and removes the presence of glow and fog in the low frequency layers. Having processed the high/low frequency information, it fuses the layers to obtain a grayscale defogged image. Our second module, the color module, takes the original RGB image as input. The module has similar operations to those of the grayscale module. However, to obtain fog-free high and low frequency information, the module is guided by the grayscale module. The reason of doing this is because grayscale images are less affected by multiple colors of atmospheric light, which are commonly present in nighttime scenes. Moreover, having the grayscale module allows us to have consistency losses between the outputs of the two modules, which is critical to our framework, since we do not have paired ground-truths for our real data. Our extensive experiments on real foggy nighttime images show the effectiveness of our method.",

The second network evaluates each candidate based on the given image and the geometric cues, where prior knowledge of man-made scenes is used for the evaluation. With the supervision of datasets consisting of the horizontal line and focal length of the images, our networks can be trained to estimate the same camera parameters. Based on the Manhattan world assumption, we can further estimate the camera rotation and focal length in a weakly supervised manner.

Thus, the processing time of the robust estimation is linear in the number of correspondences and, therefore, orders of magnitude faster than by using traditional approaches. The proposed 1AC+D solver is tested both on synthetic data and on 110 395 publicly available real image pairs where we used an off-the-shelf monocular depth network to provide up-to-scale depth per pixel. The proposed 1AC+D leads to similar accuracy as traditional approaches while being significantly faster. When solving large-scale problems, e.g. pose-graph initialization for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, the overhead of obtaining ACs and monocular depth is negligible compared to the speed-up gained in the pairwise geometric verification, i.e., relative pose estimation.

Inspired by image-based domain adaptation, we can perform video adaptation by aligning the features of frames or clips of source and target videos. However, equally aligning all clips is sub-optimal as not all clips are informative for the task. As the first novelty, we propose an attention mechanism which focuses on more discriminative clips and directly optimizes for video-level (cf. clip-level) alignment. As the backgrounds are often very different between source and target, the source background-corrupted model adapts poorly to target domain videos. To alleviate this, as a second novelty, we propose to use the clip order prediction as an auxiliary task. The clip order prediction loss, when combined with domain adversarial loss, encourages learning of representations which focus on the humans and objects involved in the actions, rather than the uninformative and widely differing (between source and target) backgrounds.

		"title": "Generating Handwriting via Decoupled Style Descriptors",
		"abstract": "Representing a space of handwriting stroke styles includes the challenge of representing both the style of each character and the overall style of the human writer. Existing VRNN approaches to representing handwriting often do not distinguish between these different style components, which can reduce model capability. Instead, we introduce the Decoupled Style Descriptor (DSD) model for handwriting, which factors both character- and writer-level styles and allows our model to represent an overall greater space of styles. This approach also increases flexibility: given a few examples, we can generate handwriting in new writer styles, and also now generate handwriting of new characters across writer styles. In experiments, our generated results were preferred over a state of the art baseline method 88% of the time, and in a writer identification task on 20 held-out writers, our DSDs achieved 89.38% accuracy from a single sample word. Overall, DSDs allows us to improve both the quality and flexibility over existing handwriting stroke generation approaches.",

		"title": "LEED: Label-Free Expression Editing via Disentanglement",
		"abstract": "Recent studies on facial expression editing have obtained very promising progress. On the other hand, existing methods face the constraint of requiring a large amount of expression labels which are often expensive and time-consuming to collect. This paper presents an innovative label-free expression editing via disentanglement (LEED) framework that is capable of editing the expression of both frontal and profile facial images without requiring any expression labels. The idea is to disentangle the identity and expression of a facial image in the expression manifold, where the neutral face captures the identity attribute and the displacement between the neutral image and the expressive image captures the expression attribute. Two novel losses are designed for optimal expression disentanglement and consistent synthesis, including a mutual expression information loss that aims to extract pure expression-related features and a siamese loss that aims to enhance the expression similarity between the synthesized image and the reference image. Extensive experiments over two public facial expression datasets show that LEED achieves superior facial expression editing qualitatively and quantitatively.",

		"abstract": "Generating accurate descriptions for online fashion items is important not only for enhancing customers' shopping experiences, but also for the increase of online sales. Besides the need of correctly presenting the attributes of items, the expressions in an enchanting style could better attract customer interests. The goal of this work is to develop a novel learning framework for accurate and expressive fashion captioning. Different from popular work on image captioning, it is hard to identify and describe the rich attributes of fashion items. We seed the description of an item by first identifying its attributes, and introduce attribute-level semantic (ALS) reward and sentence-level semantic (SLS) reward as metrics to improve the quality of text descriptions. We further integrate the training of our model with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), attribute embedding, and Reinforcement Learning (RL). To facilitate the learning, we build a new FAshion CAptioning Dataset (FACAD), which contains 800K images and 120K corresponding enchanting and diverse descriptions.

		"title": "Reducing Language Biases in Visual Question Answering with Visually-Grounded Question Encoder",
		"abstract": "Recent studies have shown that current VQA models are heavily biased on the language priors in the train set to answer the question, irrespective of the image. E.g., overwhelmingly answer \"\"what sport is\"\" as \"\"tennis\"\" or \"\"what color banana\"\" as \"\"yellow.\"\" This behavior restricts them from real-world application scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel model-agnostic question encoder, Visually-Grounded Question Encoder (VGQE), for VQA that reduces this effect. VGQE utilizes both visual and language modalities equally while encoding the question. Hence the question representation itself gets sufficient visual-grounding, and thus reduces the dependency of the model on the language priors. We demonstrate the effect of VGQE on three recent VQA models and achieve state-of-the-art results on the bias-sensitive split of the VQAv2 dataset; VQA-CPv2. Further, unlike the existing bias-reduction techniques, on the standard VQAv2 benchmark, our approach does not drop the accuracy; instead, it improves the performance.",

		"abstract": "We present a deployment friendly, fast bottom-up framework for multi-person 3D human pose estimation. We adopt a novel neural representation of multi-person 3D pose which unifies the position of person instances with their corresponding 3D pose representation. This is realized by learning a generative pose embedding which not only ensures plausible 3D pose predictions, but also eliminates the usual keypoint grouping operation as employed in prior bottom-up approaches. Further, we propose a practical deployment paradigm where paired 2D or 3D pose annotations are unavailable. In the absence of any paired supervision, we leverage a frozen network, as a teacher model, which is trained on an auxiliary task of multi-person 2D pose estimation. We cast the learning as a cross-modal alignment problem and propose training objectives to realize a shared latent space between two diverse modalities. We aim to enhance the model's ability to perform beyond the limiting teacher network by enriching the latent-to-3D pose mapping using artificially synthesized multi-person 3D scene samples. Our approach not only generalizes to in-the-wild images, but also yields a superior trade-off between speed and performance, compared to prior top-down approaches. Our approach also yields state-of-the-art multi-person 3D pose estimation performance among the bottom-up approaches under consistent supervision levels.",

Unlike these methods,our network removes moire patterns in the wavelet domain to separate the frequencies of moire patterns from the image content. The network combines dense convolution modules and dilated convolution modules supporting large receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and we further show that WDNet generalizes to removing moire artifacts on non-screen images. Although designed for image demoireing, WDNet has been applied to two other low-level vision tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art image deraining and derain-drop methods on the Rain100h and Raindrop800 data sets, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Advances in low-light video RAW-to-RGB translation are opening up the possibility of fast low-light imaging on commodity devices (e.g. smartphone cameras) without the need for a tripod. However,it is challenging to collect the required paired short-long exposure frames to learn a supervised mapping. Current approaches require a specialised rig or the use of static videos with no subject or object motion [5],resulting in datasets that are limited in size, diversity, and motion. We address the data collection bottleneck for low-light video RAW-to-RGB by proposing a data synthesis mechanism, dubbed SIDGAN, that can generate abundant dynamic video training pairs. SIDGAN maps videos found ‘in the wild’ (e.g. internet videos) into a low-light (short, long exposure) domain. By generating dynamic video data synthetically, we enable a recently proposed state-of-the-art RAW-to-RGB model to attain higher image quality (improved colour, reduced artifacts) and improved temporal consistency, compared to the same model trained with only static real video data",

The initial depth prediction is then iteratively refined by its confidence and non-local spatial propagation procedure based on the predicted non-local neighbors and corresponding affinities. Unlike previous algorithms that utilize fixed-local neighbors, the proposed algorithm effectively avoids irrelevant local neighbors and concentrates on relevant non-local neighbors during propagation. In addition, we introduce a learnable affinity normalization to better learn the affinity combinations compared to conventional methods. The proposed algorithm is inherently robust to the mixed-depth problem on depth boundaries, which is one of the major issues for existing depth estimation/completion algorithms. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to conventional algorithms in terms of depth completion accuracy and robustness to the mixed-depth problem.",

		"title": "Event Enhanced High-Quality Image Recovery",
		"abstract": "With extremely high temporal resolution, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision. However, their asynchronous imaging mechanism often aggravates the measurement sensitivity to noises and brings a physical burden to increase the image spatial resolution. To recover high-quality intensity images, one should address both denoising and super-resolution problems for event cameras. Since events depict brightness changes, with the enhanced degeneration model by the events, the clear and sharp high-resolution latent images can be recovered from the noisy, blurry and low-resolution intensity observations. Exploiting the framework of sparse learning, the events and the low-resolution intensity observations can be jointly considered. Based on this, we propose an explainable network, an event-enhanced sparse learning network (eSL-Net), to recover the high-quality images from event cameras. After training with a synthetic dataset, the proposed eSL-Net can largely improve the performance of the state-of-the-art by 7-12 dB. Furthermore, without additional training process, the proposed eSL-Net can be easily extended to generate continuous frames with frame-rate as high as the events.",

Packed features are computationally more efficient and allow to use cross-head group normalization (GN) at handy, leading to notable accuracy improvement against the common head-separate GN. All of these are only at the cost of less than 5.7% relative increase on runtime memory and introduction of a few noisy training samples, however, whose side-effects could be diminished by good packing patterns design.

When humans analyze a scene, they usually prefer to describe image gist first, namely major objects and key relations in a scene graph. This humans' inherent perceptive habit implies that there exists a hierarchical structure about humans' preference during the scene parsing procedure. Therefore, we argue that a desirable scene graph should be also hierarchically constructed, and introduce a new scheme for modeling scene graph. Concretely, a scene is represented by a human-mimetic Hierarchical Entity Tree (HET) consisting of a series of image regions. To generate a scene graph based on HET, we parse HET with a Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (Hybrid-LSTM) which specifically encodes hierarchy and siblings context to capture the structured information embedded in HET. To further prioritize key relations in the scene graph, we devise a Relation Ranking Module (RRM) to dynamically adjust their rankings by learning to capture humans' subjective perceptive habits from objective entity saliency and size. Experiments indicate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performances for scene graph generation, but also is expert in mining image-specific relations which play a great role in serving downstream tasks.",

Long exposures can improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but undesirable motion blur can occur when capturing dynamic scenes. As a result, imaging pipelines often rely on computational photography to improve SNR by fusing multiple short exposures. Recent deep neural network-based methods have been shown to generate visually pleasing results by fusing these exposures in a sophisticated manner, but often at a higher computational cost.We propose an end-to-end trainable burst denoising pipeline which jointly captures high-resolution and high-frequency deep features derived from wavelet transforms. In our model, precious local details are preserved in high-frequency sub-band features to enhance the final perceptual quality, while the low-frequency sub-band features carry structural information for faithful reconstruction and final objective quality. The model is designed to accommodate variable-length burst captures via temporal feature shifting while incurring only marginal computational overhead. Lastly, we train our model with a realistic noise model for the generalization to real environments. Using these techniques, our method attains state-of-the-art performance on perceptual quality, while being an order of magnitude faster.",

As a first step in analysis, deformable registration among different image modalities is often required in order to provide complementary visual information. During registration, semantic information is key to match homologous points and pixels. Nevertheless, many conventional registration methods are incapable in capturing high-level semantic anatomical dense correspondences. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task learning system, JSSR, based on an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network that is composed of a generator, a registration and a segmentation component. The system is optimized to satisfy the implicit constraints between different tasks in an unsupervised manner. It first synthesizes the source domain images into the target domain, then an intra-modal registration is applied on the synthesized images and target images. The segmentation module are then applied on the synthesized and target images, providing additional cues based on semantic correspondences. The supervision from another fully-annotated dataset is used to regularize the segmentation. We extensively evaluate JSSR on a large-scale medical image dataset containing 1,485 patient CT imaging studies of four different contrast phases (i.e., 5,940 3D CT scans with pathological livers) on the registration, segmentation and synthesis tasks. The performance is improved after joint training on the registration and segmentation tasks by 0.9% and 1.9% respectively compared to a highly competitive and accurate deep learning baseline. The registration also consistently outperforms conventional state-of-the-art multi-modal registration methods.",

Our approach tolerates a modest amount of noise in box placements, thus typically requiring only a few clicks to annotate a track to a sufficient accuracy. Segmentation masks are corrected via scribbles which are propagated through time. We show significant performance gains in annotation efficiency over past work.

While manually averting localizing highlight segments, weakly supervised modeling is challenging, as a video in our daily life could contain highlight segments with multiple event types, e.g., skiing and surfing. In this work, we propose casting weakly supervised video highlight detection modeling for a given specific event as a multiple instance ranking network (MINI-Net) learning. We consider each video as a bag of segments, and therefore, the proposed MINI-Net learns to enforce a higher highlight score for a positive bag that contains highlight segments of a specific event than those for negative bags that are irrelevant. In particular, we form a max-max ranking loss to acquire a reliable relative comparison between the most likely positive segment instance and the hardest negative segment instance. With this max-max ranking loss, our MINI-Net effectively leverages all segment information to acquire a more distinct video feature representation for localizing the highlight segments of a specific event in a video. The extensive experimental results on three challenging public benchmarks clearly validate the efficacy of our multiple instance ranking approach for solving the problem.",

As for the robust classification problem, a generative classifier typically models the distribution of inputs and labels, and thus can better handle off-manifold examples at the cost of a concise structure.

This work aims for a solution of generative classifiers that can profit from the merits of both. To this end, we propose an Anti-Perturbation Inference (API) method, which searches for anti-perturbations to maximize the lower bound of the joint log-likelihood of inputs and classes.

In other words, the adversarial patches were input-specific and failed to attack images from all classes, especially unseen ones during training. To address the problem, this paper proposes a bias-based framework to generate class-agnostic universal adversarial patches with strong generalization ability, which exploits both the perceptual and semantic bias of models. Regarding the perceptual bias, since DNNs are strongly biased towards textures, we exploit the hard examples which convey strong model uncertainties and extract a textural patch prior from them by adopting the style similarities. The patch prior is more close to decision boundaries and would promote attacks. To further alleviate the heavy dependency on large amounts of data in training universal attacks, we further exploit the semantic bias. As the class-wise preference, prototypes are introduced and pursued by maximizing the multi-class margin to help universal training. Taking Automatic Check-out (ACO) as the typical scenario, extensive experiments including white-box/black-box settings in both digital-world (RPC, the largest ACO related dataset) and physical-world scenario (Taobao and JD, the world’s largest online shopping platforms) are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial patch attack methods.",

Most studies have been conducted on this topic under the single-label classiﬁcation setting along with an assumption of balanced label distribution. This work expands this research horizon towards multi-label classiﬁcation. In doing so, we identify unanticipated adversity innately existent in many multilabel datasets, the long-tailed distribution. We jointly address the two independently solved problems, Catastropic Forgetting and the long-tailed label distribution by ﬁrst empirically showing a new challenge of destructive forgetting of the minority concepts on the tail. Then, we curate two benchmark datasets, COCOseq and NUS-WIDEseq, that allow the study of both intra- and inter-task imbalances. Lastly, we propose a new sampling strategy for replay-based approach named Partitioning Reservoir Sampling (PRS), which allows the model to maintain a balanced knowledge of both head and tail classes.

In addition, existing pixel-wise SSL approaches are only suitable for certain tasks as they usually require to use task-specific properties. In this paper, we present a new SSL framework, named Guided Collaborative Training (GCT), for pixel-wise tasks, with two main technical contributions. First, GCT addresses the issues caused by the dense outputs through a novel flaw detector. Second, the modules in GCT learn from unlabeled data collaboratively through two newly proposed constraints that are independent of task-specific properties. As a result, GCT can be applied to a wide range of pixel-wise tasks without structural adaptation. Our extensive experiments on four challenging vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, real image denoising, portrait image matting, and night image enhancement, show that GCT outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods by a large margin.",

Recent works in neural architecture search (NAS), especially one-shot NAS, can aid transfer learning by establishing sufficient network search space. However, existing NAS methods tend to approximate huge search spaces by explicitly building giant super-networks with multiple sub-paths, and discard super-network weights after a child structure is found. Both the characteristics of existing approaches causes repetitive network training on source tasks in transfer learning. To remedy the above issues, we reduce the super-network size by randomly dropping connection between network blocks while embedding a larger search space. Moreover, we reuse super-network weights to avoid redundant training by proposing a novel framework consisting of two modules, the neural architecture search module for architecture transfer and the neural weight search module for weight transfer. These two modules conduct search on the target task based on a reduced super-networks, so we only need to train once on the source task. We experiment our framework on both MS-COCO and CUB-200 for the object detection and fine-grained image classification tasks, and show promising improvements with only $O(C^{N})$ super-network complexity.",

This work proposes a weakly supervised approach for 3D object detection, only requiring a small set of weakly annotated scenes, associated with a few precisely labeled object instances. This is achieved by a two-stage architecture design. Stage-1 learns to generate cylindrical object proposals under weak supervision, i.e., only the horizontal centers of objects are click-annotated on bird’s view scenes. Stage-2 learns to refine the cylindrical proposals to get cuboids and confidence scores, using a few well-labeled object instances. Using only 500 weakly annotated scenes and 534 precisely labeled vehicle instances, our method achieves 85∼95% of performance of current top-leading, fully supervised detectors (requiring 3,712 exhaustively and precisely annotated scenes with 15,654 instances). Moreover, with our elaborately designed network architecture, our trained model can be applied as a 3D object annotator, supporting both automatic and active (human-in-the-loop) working modes. The annotations generated by our model can be used to train 3D object detectors achieving 94% of their original performance (with manually labeled data). Our experiments also show our model's potential in boosting performance when given more training data.

		"title": "Two-phase Pseudo Label Densification for Self-training based Domain Adaptation",
		"abstract": "Recently, deep self-training approaches emerged as a powerful solution to the unsupervised domain adaptation. The self-training scheme involves iterative processing of target data; it generates target pseudo labels and retrains the network. However, since only the confident predictions are taken as pseudo labels, existing self-training approaches inevitably produce sparse pseudo labels in practice. We see this is critical because the resulting insufficient training-signals lead to a sub-optimal, error-prone model. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a novel Two-phase Pseudo Label Densification framework, referred to as TPLD. In the first phase, we use sliding window voting to propagate the confident predictions, utilizing inherent spatial-correlations in the images. In the second phase, we perform a confidence-based easy-hard classification. For the easy samples, we now employ their full pseudo-labels. For the hard ones, we instead adopt adversarial learning to enforce hard-to-easy feature alignment. To ease the training process and avoid noisy predictions, we introduce the bootstrapping mechanism to the original self-training loss. We show the proposed TPLD can be integrated into any type of existing self-training based approaches and improve the performance significantly. Combined with the recently proposed CRST self-training framework, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on two standard UDA benchmarks.",

		"title": "Adaptive Offline Quintuplet Loss for Image-Text Matching",
		"abstract": "Existing image-text matching approaches typically leverage triplet loss with online hard negatives to train the model. For each image or text anchor in a training mini-batch, the model is trained to distinguish between a positive and the most confusing negative of the anchor mined from the mini-batch (i.e. online hard negative). This strategy improves the model's capacity to discover fine-grained correspondences and non-correspondences between image and text inputs. However, the above approach has the following drawbacks: (1) the negative selection strategy still provides limited chances for the model to learn from very hard-to-distinguish cases. (2) The trained model has weak generalization capability from the training set to the testing set. (3) The penalty lacks hierarchy and adaptiveness for hard negatives with different ``hardness'' degrees. In this paper, we propose solutions by sampling negatives offline from the whole training set. It provides ``harder'' offline negatives than online hard negatives for the model to distinguish. Based on the offline hard negatives, a quintuplet loss is proposed to improve the model's generalization capability to distinguish positives and negatives. In addition, a novel loss function that combines the knowledge of positives, offline hard negatives and online hard negatives is created. It leverages offline hard negatives as the intermediary to adaptively penalize them based on their distance relations to the anchor. We evaluate the proposed training approach on three state-of-the-art image-text models on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets.

With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms.

Practically, photo retouching can be accomplished by a series of image processing operations. In this paper, we investigate some commonly-used retouching operations and mathematically find that these pixel-independent operations can be approximated or formulated by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Based on this analysis, we propose an extremely light-weight framework - Conditional Sequential Retouching Network (CSRNet) - for efficient global image retouching. CSRNet consists of a base network and a condition network. The base network acts like an MLP that processes each pixel independently and the condition network extracts the global features of the input image to generate a condition vector. To realize retouching operations, we modulate the intermediate features using Global Feature Modulation (GFM), of which the parameters are transformed by condition vector. Benefiting from the utilization of $1 imes1$ convolution, CSRNet only contains less than 37k trainable parameters, which is orders of magnitude smaller than existing learning-based methods.

Besides the technical di\u000eculty of this task, only a few previous datasets were specially designed and collected to explore this task and most of the existing datasets have major drawbacks. They either possess limited sample size such as merely a thousand of images without manual annotations, or they generate all images by using computer graphics method (i.e. not real image).

This task has been paid much attention since bokeh effects are widely used in digital cameras and smartphone photography. However, identifying obscure homogeneous regions and borderline transitions in partially defocus images are still challenging. To solve these problems, we introduce depth information into DBD for the first time. When the camera parameters are fixed, we argue that the accuracy of DBD is highly related to scene depth. Hence, we consider the depth information as the approximate soft label of DBD and propose a joint learning framework inspired by knowledge distillation. In detail, we learn the defocus blur from ground truth and the depth distilled from a well-trained depth estimation network at the same time. Thus, the sharp region will provide a strong prior for depth estimation while the blur detection also gains benefits from the distilled depth. Besides, we propose a novel decoder in the fully convolutional network (FCN) as our network structure. In each level of decoder, we design the Selective Reception Field Block (SRFB) for merging multi-scale features efficiently and reuse the side outputs as Supervision-guided Attention Block(SAB).

		"title": "SemanticAdv: Generating Adversarial Examples via Attribute-conditioned Image Editing",
		"abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great successes in various vision applications due to their strong expressive power. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples which are manipulated instances targeting to mislead DNNs to make incorrect predictions. Currently, most such adversarial examples try to guarantee ``subtle perturbation\"\" by limiting the $L_p$ norm of the perturbation. In this paper, we propose SemanticAdv to generate a new type of semantically realistic adversarial examples via attribute-conditioned image editing. Compared to existing methods, our SemanticAdv enables fine-grained analysis and evaluation of DNNs with input variations in the attribute space. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our adversarial examples not only exhibit semantically meaningful appearances but also achieve high targeted attack success rates under both whitebox and blackbox settings. Moreover, we show that the existing pixel-based and attribute-based defense methods fail to defend against our attribute-conditioned adversarial examples. We demonstrate the applicability of SemanticAdv on both face recognition and general street-view images to show its generalization. Such non-$L_p$ bounded adversarial examples with controlled attribute manipulation can shed light on further understanding about vulnerabilities of DNNs as well as novel defense approaches.",

		"abstract": "Instance segmentation has achieved siginificant progress in the presence of correctly annotated datasets. Yet, object classes in large-scale datasets are sometimes ambiguous, which easily causes confusion. In addition, limited experience and knowledge of annotators can also lead to mislabeled object classes. To solve this issue, a novel method is proposed in this paper, which uses different losses describing different roles of noisy class labels to enhance the learning. Specifically, in instance segmentation, noisy class labels play different roles in the foreground-background sub-task and the foreground-instance sub-task. Hence, on the one hand, the noise-robust loss (e.g., symmetric loss) is used to prevent incorrect gradient guidance for the foreground-instance sub-task. On the other hand, standard cross entropy loss is used to fully exploit correct gradient guidance for the foreground-background sub-task. Extensive experiments conducted with three popular datasets (i.e., Pascal VOC, Cityscapes and COCO) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in a wide range of noisy class labels scenarios.",

In this paper, we propose a novel deep image clustering framework to learn a category-style latent representation in which the category information is disentangled from image style and can be directly used as the cluster assignment. To achieve this goal, mutual information maximization is applied to embed relevant information in the latent representation. Moreover, augmentation-invariant loss is employed to disentangle the representation into category part and style part. Last but not least, a prior distribution is imposed on the latent representation to ensure the elements of the category vector can be used as the probabilities over clusters.

These blocks guide the network attention to global structures or local details across different feature layers. Second, we introduce a global focal relative loss for uniform point pairs to enhance spatial constraint in the prediction, and explicitly increase the penalty on errors in depth-wise discontinuous regions, which helps preserve the sharpness of estimation results. Finally, based on analysis of failure cases for prior methods, we collect a new Hard Case (HC) Depth dataset of challenging scenes, such as special lighting conditions, dynamic objects, and tilted camera angles.

The consensus of previous research is that optimizing with the extit{hardest} negative examples leads to bad training behavior. That's a problem -- these hardest negatives are literally the cases where the distance metric fails to capture semantic similarity. In this paper, we characterize the space of triplets and derive why hard negatives make triplet loss training fail. We offer a simple fix to the loss function and show that, with this fix, optimizing with hard negative examples becomes feasible.

We first construct a base- line network by modifying and binarizing a compact real-valued network with parameter-free shortcuts, bypassing all the intermediate convolu- tional layers including the downsampling layers. This baseline network strikes a good trade-o↵ between accuracy and e ciency, achieving su- perior performance than most of existing binary networks at approxi- mately half of the computational cost. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we observed that the performance of binary networks is sensitive to activation distribution variations. Based on this important observation, we propose to generalize the traditional Sign and PReLU functions, denoted as RSign and RPReLU for the respective general- ized functions, to enable explicit learning of the distribution reshape and shift at near-zero extra cost. Lastly, we adopt a distributional loss to further enforce the binary network to learn similar output distribu- tions as those of a real-valued network. We show that after incorporating all these ideas, the proposed ReActNet outperforms all the state-of-the- arts by a large margin. Specifically, it outperforms Real-to-Binary Net and MeliusNet29 by 4.0% and 3.6% respectively for the top-1 accuracy and also reduces the gap to its real-valued counterpart to within 3.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet dataset.

We then use real-time trackers to exploit temporal cues and track the detected objects in the remaining frames, which enhances efficiency and temporal coherence. Object status at the bounding-box level is propagated across frames and updated by our aggregation modules. For keyframe scheduling, we propose adaptive policies using reinforcement learning and simple heuristics.

Consider an object category like faces that is annotated in one dataset, but is not annotated in another dataset, although the object itself appears in the later's images. Some categories, like face here, would thus be considered foreground in one dataset, but background in another. To address this challenge, we design a framework which works with such partial annotations, and we exploit a pseudo labeling approach that we adapt for our specific case.

We propose a new end-to-end architecture that directly extracts a bird's-eye-view representation of a scene given image data from an arbitrary number of cameras. The core idea behind our approach is to ``lift'' each image individually into a frustum of features for each camera, then ``splat'' all frustums into a rasterized bird's-eye-view grid.

However, the task itself is quite challenging because there is a huge modality gap between images and physical descriptions of attributes. Often, there may also be a large number of unseen categories (attribute combinations). The current state-of-the-art methods either focus on learning better cross-modal embeddings by mining only seen data, or they explicitly use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize unseen features. The former tends to produce poor embeddings due to insufficient data, while the latter does not preserve intra-class compactness during generation. In this paper, we present a symbiotic adversarial learning framework, called SAL. Two GANs sit at the base of the framework in a symbiotic learning scheme: one synthesizes features of unseen classes/categories, while the other optimizes the embedding and performs the cross-modal alignment on the common embedding space. Specifically, two different types of generative adversarial networks learn collaboratively throughout the training process and the interactions between the two mutually benefit each other.

To further improve the performance, we build our network using two parallel branches which operate in an adversarial way: the first branch localizes the most salient activities of a video and the second one finds other supplementary activities from non-localized parts of the video. Extensive experiments performed on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is effective.

The current dominant approaches use supervised learning to solve this problem.

In this paper, we present a new approach based on continual learning that uses feature-level predictions for self-supervision. It does not require any training annotations in terms of frame-level bounding boxes. The approach is inspired by cognitive models of visual event perception that propose a prediction-based approach to event understanding. We use a stack of LSTMs coupled with a CNN encoder, along with novel attention mechanisms, to model the events in the video and use this model to predict high-level features for the future frames. The prediction errors are used to learn the parameters of the models continuously. This self-supervised framework is not complicated as other approaches but is very effective in learning robust visual representations for both labeling and localization. It should be noted that the approach outputs in a streaming fashion, requiring only a single pass through the video, making it amenable for real-time processing. We demonstrate this on three datasets - UCF Sports, JHMDB, and THUMOS'13 and show that the proposed approach outperforms weakly-supervised and unsupervised baselines and obtains competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines.

Empirical evaluations on a synthetic dataset (SURREAL) as well as a real-world dataset (PHSPD) demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative performance of our approach in estimating human poses and shapes.

Different from most previous explorations that often aim at developing adversarial-based domain alignment solutions, we tackle this challenging task from a new perspective, \u001bmph{i.e.}, content-consistent matching (CCM). The target of CCM is to acquire those synthetic images that share similar distribution with the real ones in the target domain, so that the domain gap can be naturally alleviated by employing the content-consistent synthetic images for training. To be specific, we facilitate the CCM from two aspects, \u001bmph{i.e.}, semantic layout matching and pixel-wise similarity matching. First, we use all the synthetic images from the source domain to train an initial segmentation model, which is then employed to produce coarse pixel-level labels for the unlabeled images in the target domain. With the coarse/accurate label maps for real/synthetic images, we construct their semantic layout matrixes from both horizontal and vertical directions and perform the matrixes matching to find out the synthetic images with similar semantic layout to real images. Second, we choose those predicted labels with high confidence to generate feature embeddings for all classes in the target domain, and further perform the pixel-wise matching on the mined layout-consistent synthetic images to harvest the appearance-consistent pixels. With the proposed CCM, only those content-consistent synthetic images are taken into account for learning the segmentation model, which can effectively alleviate the domain bias caused by those content-irrelevant synthetic images. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular domain adaptation tasks, \u001bmph{i.e.}, GTA5$\\xrightarrow{}$Cityscapes and SYNTHIA$\\xrightarrow{}$Cityscapes. Our CCM yields consistent improvements over the baselines and performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.",

		"title": "AE TextSpotter: Learning Visual and Linguistic Representation for Ambiguous Text Spotting",
		"abstract": "Scene text spotting aims to detect and recognize the entire word or sentence with multiple characters in natural images. It is still challenging because ambiguity often occurs when the spacing between characters is large or the characters are evenly spread in multiple rows and columns, making many visually plausible groupings of the characters (e.g. \"\"BERLIN\"\" is incorrectly detected as \"\"BERL\"\" and \"\"IN\"\" in Fig. 1(c)). Unlike previous works that merely employed visual features for text detection, this work proposes a novel text spotter, named Ambiguity Eliminating Text Spotter (AE TextSpotter), which learns both visual and linguistic features to significantly reduce ambiguity in text detection. The proposed AE TextSpotter has three important benefits. 1) A carefully designed language module is utilized to reduce the detection confidence of incorrect text lines, making them easily pruned in the detection stage. 2) The linguistic representation is learned together with the visual representation in a framework. To our knowledge, it is the first time to improve text detection by using a language model. 3) Extensive experiments show that AE TextSpotter outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. For example, we carefully select a set of extremely ambiguous samples from the IC19-ReCTS dataset, where our approach surpasses other methods by more than 4%.",

In particular, instead of modeling frame-wise attention via pose similarity, we propose to extract motion attention to capture the similarity between the current motion context and the historical motion sub-sequences. Aggregating the relevant past motions and processing the result with a graph convolutional network allows us to effectively exploit motion patterns from the long-term history to predict the future poses. Our experiments on Human3.6M, AMASS and 3DPW evidence the benefits of our approach for both periodical and non-periodical actions.

		"title": "Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation with Joint Hotspot Tracking",
		"abstract": "Object tracking is a well-studied problem in computer vision while identifying salient spots of objects in a video is a less explored direction in the literature. Video eye gaze estimation methods aim to tackle a related task but salient spots in those methods are not bounded by objects and tend to produce very scattered, unstable predictions due to the noisy ground truth data. We reformulate the problem of detecting and tracking of salient object spots as a new task called object hotspot tracking. In this paper, we propose to tackle this task jointly with unsupervised video object segmentation, in real-time, with a unified framework to exploit the synergy between the two. Specifically, we propose a Weighted Correlation Siamese Network (WCS-Net) which employs a Weighted Correlation Block (WCB) for encoding the pixel-wise correspondence between a template frame and the search frame. In addition, WCB takes the initial mask / hotspot as guidance to enhance the influence of salient regions for robust tracking. Our system can operate online during inference and jointly produce the object mask and hotspot track-lets at 33 FPS. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our network design, and show the benefits of jointly solving the hotspot tracking and object segmentation problems. In particular, our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art video eye gaze models in object hotspot tracking, and outperforms existing methods on three benchmark datasets for unsupervised video object segmentation.",

		"title": "SRNet: Improving Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation with a Split-and-Recombine Approach",
		"abstract": "Human poses that are rare or unseen in a training set are challenging for a network to predict. Similar to the long-tailed distribution problem in visual recognition, the small number of examples for such poses limits the ability of networks to model them. Interestingly, local pose distributions suffer less from the long-tail problem, i.e., local joint configurations within a rare pose may appear within other poses in the training set, making them less rare. We propose to take advantage of this fact for better generalization to rare and unseen poses. To be specific, our method splits the body into local regions and processes them in separate network branches, utilizing the property that a joint’s position depends mainly on the joints within its local body region. Global coherence is maintained by recombining the global context from the rest of the body into each branch as a low-dimensional vector. With the reduced dimensionality of less relevant body areas, the training set distribution within network branches more closely reflects the statistics of local poses instead of global body poses, without sacrificing information important for joint inference. The proposed split-and-recombine approach, called SRNet, can be easily adapted to both single-image and temporal models, and it leads to appreciable improvements in the prediction of rare and unseen poses.",

One-stage detectors are more efficient owing to straightforward architectures, but the two-stage detectors still take the lead in accuracy. Although recent work try to improve the one-stage detectors by imitating the structural design of the two-stage ones, the accuracy gap is still significant. In this paper, we propose MimicDet, a novel and efficient framework to train a one-stage detector by directly mimic the two-stage features, aiming to bridge the accuracy gap between one-stage and two-stage detectors. Unlike conventional mimic methods, MimicDet has a shared backbone for one-stage and two-stage detectors, then it branches into two heads which are well designed to have compatible features for mimicking. Thus MimicDet can be end-to-end trained without the pre-train of the teacher network. And the cost of memory does not increase much, which makes it practical to adopt large networks as backbones. We also make several specialized designs such as dual-path mimicking and staggered feature pyramid to facilitate the mimicking process. Experiments on the challenging COCO detection benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MimicDet. It achieves 46.1 mAP with ResNeXt-101 backbone on the COCO test-dev set, which significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.",

		"abstract": "Perturb, and Explore: Learning a Feature Alignment Network for Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation\",\"Although unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely adopted across several computer vision tasks, it is more desirable if we can exploit a few labeled data from new domains encountered in a real application. The novel setting of the semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) problem shares the challenges with the domain adaptation problem and the semi-supervised learning problem. However, a recent study shows that conventional domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning methods often result in less effective or negative transfer in the SSDA problem. In order to interpret the observation and address the SSDA problem, in this paper, we raise the intra-domain discrepancy issue within the target domain, which has never been discussed so far. Then, we demonstrate that addressing the intra-domain discrepancy leads to the ultimate goal of the SSDA problem. We propose an SSDA framework that aims to align features via alleviation of the intra-domain discrepancy. Our framework mainly consists of three schemes, i.e., attraction, perturbation, and exploration. First, the attraction scheme globally minimizes the intra-domain discrepancy within the target domain. Second, we demonstrate the incompatibility of the conventional adversarial perturbation methods with SSDA. Then, we present a domain adaptive adversarial perturbation scheme, which perturbs the given target samples in a way that reduces the intra-domain discrepancy. Finally, the exploration scheme locally aligns features in a class-wise manner complementary to the attraction scheme by selectively aligning unlabeled target features complementary to the perturbation scheme.

The intuition behind is to force the curriculum manager to constantly re-measure the tranferability of latent domains over time to adversarially raise the error rate of the domain discriminator. CMSS does not require any knowledge of the domain labels yet it outperforms other methods on four well-known benchmarks by significant margins.

		"abstract": "Despite great progress in supervised semantic segmentation, a large performance drop is usually observed when deploying the model in the wild. Domain adaptation methods tackle the issue by aligning the source domain and the target domain. However, most existing methods attempt to perform the alignment from a holistic view, ignoring the underlying class-level data structure in the target domain. To fully exploit the supervision in the source domain, we propose a fine-grained adversarial learning strategy for class-level feature alignment while preserving the internal structure of semantics across domains. We adopt a fine-grained domain discriminator that not only plays as a domain distinguisher, but also differentiates domains at class level. The traditional binary domain labels are also generalized to domain encodings as the supervision signal to guide a fine-grained feature alignment. An analysis with Class Center Distance (CCD) validates that our fine-grained adversarial strategy achieves better class-level alignment compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Modern in-stance segmentation methods relying on fully convolutional networks perform pixel-wise classification, which ignores object boundaries and shapes, leading coarse and indistinct mask prediction results and imprecise localization. To remedy this, we propose a conceptually simple yet effective Boundary-guided Mask R-CNN (BMask R-CNN) to leverage object boundary information to improve mask localization accuracy. BMask R-CNN contains a boundary-preserving mask head in which object boundary and mask are mutually learned via feature fusion blocks. As a result, the mask prediction results are better aligned with object boundaries. Without bells and whistles, BMask R-CNN outperforms Mask R-CNN by a considerable margin on the COCO dataset; in the Cityscapes dataset, there are more accurate boundary groundtruths available, so that BMask R-CNN obtains remarkable improvements over Mask R-CNN.

The proposed method does not necessitate 3D supervision, manually annotated keypoints, multi-view images of an object or a prior 3D template. The key insight of our work is that objects can be represented as a collection of deformable parts, and each part is semantically coherent across different instances of the same category (e.g., wings on birds and wheels on cars). Therefore, by leveraging self-supervisedly learned part segmentation of a large collection of category-specific images, we can effectively enforce semantic consistency between the reconstructed meshes and the original images. This significantly reduces ambiguities during joint prediction of shape and camera pose of an object, along with texture. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to try and solve the single-view reconstruction problem without a category-specific template mesh or semantic keypoints. Thus our model can easily generalize to various object categories without such labels, e.g., horses, penguins, etc. Through a variety of experiments on several categories of deformable and rigid objects, we demonstrate that our unsupervised method performs comparably if not better than existing category-specific reconstruction methods learned with supervision.",

It is inspired by the fact that eigen-decomposition of a extit{block diagonal} matrix can be efficiently obtained by decomposing each of its diagonal square matrices, which are of smaller sizes. Instead of using a full covariance matrix as in the literature, we generate a block diagonal one by randomly grouping the channels and only considering the covariance within the same group. We insert ReDro as an additional layer before the step of matrix normalisation and make its random grouping transparent to all subsequent layers. Additionally, we can view the ReDro scheme as a dropout-like regularisation, which drops the channel relationship across groups. As experimentally demonstrated, for the SPD methods typically involving the matrix normalisation step, ReDro can effectively help them reduce computational cost in learning large-sized SPD visual representation and also help to improve image recognition performance.",

We first propose an occlusion-aware view synthesis method to apply multi-view geometry consistency to self-supervised learning. Then we design three novel loss functions for multi-view consistency, including the pixel consistency loss, the depth consistency loss, and the facial landmark-based epipolar loss. Our method is accurate and robust, especially under large variations of expressions, poses, and illumination conditions.

We propose the Asynchronous Interaction Aggregation network (AIA) that leverages different interactions to boost action detection.

We provide empirical evidence to show that our network can gain notable accuracy from the integrative interactions and is easy to train end-to-end.

Our particular contribution in this paper is a representation of the distribution over cameras, which we call ``camera-multiplex\"\". Instead of picking a point estimate, we maintain a set of camera hypotheses that are optimized during training to best explain the image given the current shape and texture. We call our approach Unsupervised Category-Specific Mesh Reconstruction (U-CMR), and present qualitative and quantitative results on CUB, Pascal 3D and new web-scraped datasets.

		"abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for 3D shape representation learning, namely Hyperbolic Embedded Attentive Representation (HEAR). Different from existing multi-view based methods, HEAR develops a unified framework to address both multi-view redundancy and single-view incompleteness. Specifically, HEAR firstly employs a hybrid attention (HA) module, which consists of a view-agnostic attention (VAA) block and a view-specific attention (VSA) block. These two blocks jointly explore distinct but complementary spatial saliency of local features for each single-view image. Subsequently, a multi-granular view pooling (MVP) module is introduced to aggregate the multi-view features with different granularities in a coarse-to-fine manner. The resulting feature set implicitly has hierarchical relations, which are therefore projected into a Hyperbolic space by adopting the Hyperbolic embedding. A hierarchical representation is learned by Hyperbolic multi-class logistic regression based on the Hyperbolic geometry. Experimental results clearly show that HEAR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on three 3D shape recognition tasks including generic 3D shape retrieval, 3D shape classification and sketch-based 3D shape retrieval.",

		"abstract": "Despite the impressive performance under the single-domain setup, current fully-supervised models for person re-identification (re-ID) degrade significantly when deployed to an unseen domain. According to the characteristics of cross-domain re-ID, such degradation is mainly attributed to the dramatic variation within the target domain and the severe shift between the source and target domain. To achieve a model that generalizes well to the target domain, it is desirable to take both issues into account. In terms of the former issue, one of the most successful solutions is to enforce consistency between nearest-neighbors in the embedding space. However, we find that the search of neighbors is highly biased due to the discrepancy across cameras. To this end, we improve the vanilla neighborhood invariance approach by imposing the constraint in a camera-aware manner. As for the latter issue, we propose a novel cross-domain mixup scheme. It alleviates the abrupt transfer by introducing the interpolation between the two domains as a transition state.

To reduce the annotation cost, one attractive solution is to leverage a large number of unlabeled images to build a crowd counting model in semi-supervised fashion. This paper tackles the semi-supervised crowd counting problem from the perspective of feature learning. Our key idea is to leverage the unlabeled images to train a generic feature extractor rather than the entire network of a crowd counter. The rationale of this design is that learning the feature extractor can be more reliable and robust towards the inevitable noisy supervision generated from the unlabeled data. Also, on top of a good feature extractor, it is possible to build a density map regressor with much fewer density map annotations. Specifically, we proposed a novel semi-supervised crowd counting method which is built upon two innovative components: (1) a set of inter-related binary segmentation tasks are derived from the original density map regression task as the surrogate prediction target; (2) the surrogate target predictors are learned from both labeled and unlabeled data by utilizing a proposed self-training scheme which fully exploits the underlying constraints of these binary segmentation tasks. Through experiments, we show that the proposed method is superior over the existing semi-supervised crowd counting method and other representative baselines.",

Consequently, we propose Dynamic R-CNN to adjust the label assignment criteria (IoU threshold) and the shape of regression loss function (parameters of SmoothL1 Loss) automatically based on the statistics of proposals during training. This dynamic design makes better use of the training samples and pushes the detector to fit more high quality samples.

		"title": "Matching Guided Distillation",
		"abstract": "Feature distillation is an effective way to improve the performance for a smaller student model, which has fewer parameters and lower computation cost compared to the larger teacher model. Unfortunately, there is a common obstacle $-$ the gap in semantic feature structure between the intermediate features of teacher and student. The classic scheme prefers to transform intermediate features by adding the adaptation module, such as naive convolutional, attention-based or more complicated one. However, this introduces two problems: a) The adaptation module brings more parameters into training. b) The adaptation module with random initialization or special transformation isn't friendly for distilling a pre-trained student. In this paper, we present Matching Guided Distillation (MGD) as an efficient and parameter-free manner to solve these problems. The key idea of MGD is to pose matching the teacher channels with students' as an assignment problem. We compare three solutions of the assignment problem to reduce channels from teacher features with partial distillation loss. The overall training takes a coordinate-descent approach between two optimization objects $-$ assignments update and parameters update. Since MGD only contains normalization or pooling operations with negligible computation cost, it is flexible to plug into network with other distillation methods.

The spatial part reconstructs the last individual frame (LIF), and the temporal part generates the RGB difference between the rest of video frames and the LIF, where the fast obtained RGB difference cue can learn useful motion features. Two sub-modules independently learn the regularity from appearance and motion feature space, the abnormal events which are irregular in appearance or in motion behavior lead to a large reconstruction error. Besides, we design a deep k-means cluster constraint to force both the appearance encoder and the motion encoder to extract common factors of variation within the dataset by penalizing the distance of each data representation to cluster centers.

We develop a style skip connection based generative adversarial network, referred to as SSCGAN which enables accurate facial attribute manipulation. Specifically, we inject the target attribute information into multiple style skip connection paths between the encoder and decoder. Each connection extracts the style feature of the latent feature maps in the encoder and then performs a residual learning based mapping function in the global information space guided by the target attributes. In the following, the adjusted style feature will be utilized as the conditional information for instance normalization to transform the corresponding latent feature maps in the decoder. In addition, to avoid the vanishing of spatial details ( extit{e.g.} hairstyle or pupil locations), we further introduce the skip connection based spatial information transfer module.

GSNet utilizes a unique four-way feature extraction and fusion scheme and directly regresses 6DoF poses and shapes in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments show that our diverse feature extraction and fusion scheme can greatly improve model performance. Based on a divide-and-conquer 3D shape representation strategy, GSNet reconstructs 3D vehicle shape with great detail (1352 vertices and 2700 faces). This dense mesh representation further leads us to consider geometrical consistency and scene context, and inspires a new multi-objective loss function to regularize network training, which in turn improves the accuracy of 6D pose estimation and validates the merit of jointly performing both tasks. We evaluate GSNet on the largest multi-task ApolloCar3D benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

Thus the running speed can be selected to meet various computational resource limits. Networks trained with the proposed method are named Resolution Switchable Networks (RS-Nets). The basic training framework shares network parameters for handling images which differ in resolution, yet keeps separate batch normalization layers. Though it is parameter-efficient in design, it leads to inconsistent accuracy variations at different resolutions, for which we provide a detailed analysis from the aspect of the train-test recognition discrepancy. A multi-resolution ensemble distillation is further designed, where a teacher is learnt on the fly as a weighted ensemble over resolutions. Thanks to the ensemble and knowledge distillation, RS-Nets enjoy accuracy improvements at a wide range of resolutions compared with individually trained models. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset are provided, and we additionally consider quantization problems. Code and models are available at https://github.com/yikaiw/RS-Nets",

		"abstract": "Recovering multi-person 3D poses with absolute scales from a single RGB image is a challenging problem due to the inherent depth and scale ambiguity from a single view. Addressing this ambiguity requires to aggregate various cues over the entire image, such as body sizes, scene layouts, and inter-person relationships. However, most previous methods adopt a top-down scheme that first performs 2D pose detection and then regresses the 3D pose and scale for each detected person individually, ignoring global contextual cues. In this paper, we propose a novel system that first regresses a set of 2.5D representations of body parts and then reconstructs the 3D absolute poses based on these 2.5D representations with a depth-aware part association algorithm. Such a single-shot bottom-up scheme allows the system to better learn and reason about the inter-person depth relationship, improving both 3D and 2D pose estimation.

		"title": "Learning to Detect Open Classes for Universal Domain Adaptation",
		"abstract": "Universal domain adaptation (UDA) transfers knowledge between domains without any constraint on the label sets, extending the applicability of domain adaptation in the wild. In UDA, both the source and target label sets may hold individual labels not shared by the other domain. A \u001bmph{de facto} challenge of UDA is to classify the target examples in the shared classes against the domain shift. Another more prominent challenge of UDA is to mark the target examples in the target-individual label set (open classes) as ``unknown''. These two entangled challenges make UDA a highly under-explored problem. Previous work on UDA focuses on the classification of data in the shared classes and uses per-class accuracy as the evaluation metric, which is badly biased to the accuracy of shared classes. However, accurately detecting open classes is the mission-critical task to enable real universal domain adaptation. It further turns UDA problem into a well-established close-set domain adaptation problem. Towards accurate open class detection, we propose Calibrated Multiple Uncertainties (CMU) with a novel transferability measure estimated by a mixture of uncertainty quantities in complementation: entropy, confidence and consistency, defined on conditional probabilities calibrated by a multi-classifier ensemble model. The new transferability measure accurately quantifies the inclination of a target example to the open classes. We also propose a novel evaluation metric called H-score, which emphasizes the importance of both accuracies of the shared classes and the ``unknown'' class. Empirical results under the UDA setting show that CMU outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on all the evaluation metrics, especially by a large margin on the H-score.",

VCL first decomposes an HOI representation into object and verb specific features, and then composes new interaction samples in the feature space via stitching the decomposed features. The integration of decomposition and composition enables VCL to share object and verb features among different HOI samples and images, and to generate new interaction samples and new types of HOI, and thus largely alleviates the long-tail distribution problem and benefits low-shot or zero-shot HOI detection.

Since sketches are difficult to collect, previous methods mainly use edge maps instead of sketches to train models (referred to as edge-based models). However, human-drawn sketches display great structural discrepancy with edge maps, thus failing edge-based models. Moreover, sketches often demonstrate huge variety among different users, demanding even higher generalizability and robustness for the editing model to work. In this paper, we propose Deep Plastic Surgery, a novel, robust and controllable image editing framework that allows users to interactively edit images using hand-drawn sketch inputs. We present a sketch refinement strategy, as inspired by the coarse-to-fine drawing process of the artists, which we show can help our model well adapt to casual and varied sketches without the need for real sketch training data. Our model further provides a refinement level control parameter that enables users to flexibly define how ``reliable'' the input sketch should be considered for the final output, balancing between sketch faithfulness and output verisimilitude (as the two goals might contradict if the input sketch is drawn poorly). To achieve the multi-level refinement, we introduce a style-based module for level conditioning, which allows adaptive feature representations for different levels in a singe network.

To tackle the WSOL problem, most previous studies have followed the conventional class activation mapping (CAM) pipeline: (i) training CNNs for a classification objective, (ii) generating a class activation map via global average pooling (GAP) on feature maps, and (iii) extracting bounding boxes by thresholding based on the maximum value of the class activation map. In this work, we reveal the current CAM approach suffers from three fundamental issues: (i) the bias of GAP that assigns a higher weight to a channel with a small activation area, (ii) negatively weighted activations inside the object regions and (iii) instability from the use of the maximum value of a class activation map as a thresholding reference. They collectively cause the problem that the localization to be highly limited to small regions of an object. We propose three simple but robust techniques that alleviate the problems, including thresholded average pooling, negative weight clamping, and percentile as a standard for thresholding. Our solutions are universally applicable to any WSOL methods using CAM and improve their performance drastically. As a result, we achieve the new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets of CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and OpenImages30K.",

More specifically, we introduce a novel architecture controlling module in each layer to encode the network architecture by a vector. By maximizing the mutual information between the vectors and input images, the module is trained to select specific filters to distill a unique calculation path for each input. Furthermore, to improve the interpretability and compactness of the decoupled network, the output of each layer is encoded to align the architecture encoding vector with the constraint of sparsity regularization. Unlike conventional pixel-level or filter-level network interpretation methods, we propose a path-level analysis to explore the relationship between the combination of filter and semantic concepts, which is more suitable to interpret the working rationale of the network.

Then a joint-training strategy is proposed to deal with the domain gaps between multiple data sources and formats in webly-supervised learning. Several good practices, including data balancing, resampling, and cross-dataset mixup are adopted in joint training. Experiments show that by utilizing data from multiple sources and formats, OmniSource is more data-efficient in training.

Current hand-designed lane detection methods are not robust enough to capture the curve lanes especially the remote ones due to the lack of modeling both long-range contextual information and detailed curve trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel lane-sensitive architecture search framework named CurveLane-NAS to automatically capture both long-ranged coherent and accurate short-range curve information while unifying both architecture search and post-processing on curve lane predictions via point blending. It consists of three search modules: a) a feature fusion search module to find a better fusion of the local and global context for multi-level hierarchy features; b) an elastic backbone search module to explore an efficient feature extractor with good semantics and latency; c) an adaptive point blending module to search a multi-level post-processing refinement strategy to combine multi-level head prediction. The unified framework ensures lane-sensitive predictions by the mutual guidance between NAS and adaptive point blending. Furthermore, we also steer forward to release a more challenging benchmark named CurveLanes for addressing the most difficult curve lanes. It consists of 150K images with 680K labels. Experiments on the new CurveLanes show that the SOTA lane detection methods suffer substantial performance drop while our model can still reach an 80+% F1-score. Extensive experiments on traditional lane benchmarks such as CULane also demonstrate the superiority of our CurveLane-NAS, e.g. achieving a new SOTA result 74.8% of F1-score on CULane dataset.",

However, most existing works address the domain discrepancy by aligning the data distributions of two domains at a global image level whereas the local consistencies are largely neglected. This paper presents an innovative local contextual-relation consistent domain adaptation (CrCDA) technique that aims to achieve local-level consistencies during the global-level alignment. The idea is to take a closer look at region-wise feature representations and align them for local-level consistencies. Specifically, CrCDA learns and enforces the prototypical local contextual-relations explicitly in the feature space of a labelled source domain while transferring them to an unlabelled target domain via backpropagation-based adversarial learning. An adaptive entropy max-min adversarial learning scheme is designed to optimally align these hundreds of local contextual-relations across domain without requiring discriminator or extra computation overhead. The proposed CrCDA has been evaluated extensively over two challenging domain adaptive segmentation tasks (e.g., GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes), and experiments demonstrate its superior segmentation performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

In practice, this is an important problem; as we do not know labels in target domain datasets, we do not know whether or not its distribution is identical to that in the source domain dataset. Despite the inaccessibility to the shape of label distribution in the target domain, a common approach of modern UDA methods reduces the gap between the feature distributions of source and target domains, which implicitly assumes that the label distributions are identical, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance upon target shift. To overcome this problem, the proposed method, partially shared variational autoencoders (PS-VAEs), uses a pair-wise feature alignment instead of feature distribution matching. PS-VAEs inter-convert domain of each sample by a CycleGAN-based architecture while preserving its label-related content by sharing weights of two domain conversion branches as much as possible. To evaluate the performance of PS-VAEs, we carried out two experiments: UDA from synthesized data to real observation in human-pose estimation (regression) and UDA under controlled target shift intensities with digits datasets (classification).

We show that the enhanced grafted network reaches competitive average precision (AP50) scores to the pretrained network on an object detection task using thermal and event camera datasets, with no increase in inference costs. Particularly, the grafted network driven by thermal frames showed a relative improvement of 49.11% over the use of intensity frames.

We exploit the focal symmetry property in the light field focal stacks for recovering the depths of similar-looking particles. We further develop a motion-constrained optical flow estimation algorithm by enforcing the local motion rigidity and the Navier-Stoke fluid constraint.

		"title": "Contextual Diversity for Active Learning",
		"abstract": "Requirement of large annotated datasets restricts the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for many practical applications. The problem can be mitigated by using active learning (AL) techniques which, under a given annotation budget, allow to select a subset of data that yields maximum accuracy upon fine tuning. State of the art AL approaches typically relies on measures of visual diversity or prediction uncertainty, which are unable to effectively capture the variations in the spatial context. On the other hand, modern CNN architectures make heavy use of spatial context for achieving highly accurate predictions. Since the context is difficult to evaluate in the absence of ground-truth labels, we introduce the notion of contextual diversity that captures the confusion associated with spatially co-occurring classes. Contextual Diversity (CD) hinges on a crucial observation that the probability vector predicted by a CNN for a region of interest typically contains information from a larger receptive field. Exploiting this observation, we use the proposed CD measure within two AL frameworks: (1) a core-set based strategy and (2) a reinforcement learning based policy, for the active frame selection. Our extensive empirical evaluation establishes state of the art results for active learning on benchmark datasets of Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection and Image classification. Our ablation studies show clear advantages of using contextual diversity for active learning.",

Recently, extensive approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression artifacts at the decoder side; however, they require a series of architecture-identical models to process images with different quality, which are inefficient and resource-consuming. Besides, it is common in practice that compressed images are with unknown quality and it is intractable for existing approaches to select a suitable model for blind quality enhancement. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient blind quality enhancement (RBQE) approach for compressed images. Specifically, our approach blindly and progressively enhances the quality of compressed images through a dynamic deep neural network (DNN), in which an early-exit strategy is embedded. Then, our approach can automatically decide to terminate or continue enhancement according to the assessed quality of enhanced images. Consequently, slight artifacts can be removed in a simpler and faster process, while the severe artifacts can be further removed in a more elaborate process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RBQE approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both blind quality enhancement and resource efficiency.",

We show that patches trained on one category of objects from ShapeNet can also represent detailed shapes from any other category as well. In addition, our patches can be trained using much fewer shapes, compared to existing approaches.

In this paper, we propose to fully calibrate a multi-camera system from scratch using an infrastructure-based approach. Assuming that the distortion is mainly radial, we introduce a two-stage approach. We first estimate the camera-rig extrinsics up to a single unknown translation component per camera. Next, we solve for both the intrinsic parameters and the missing translation components. Extensive experiments on multiple indoor and outdoor scenes with multiple multi-camera systems show that our calibration method achieves high accuracy and robustness. In particular, our approach is more robust than the naive approach of first estimating intrinsic parameters and pose per camera before refining the extrinsic parameters of the system.

		"title": "Invertible Zero-Shot Recognition Flows",
		"abstract": "Deep generative models have been successfully applied to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) recently. However, the underlying drawbacks of GANs and VAEs (e.g., the hardness of training with ZSL-oriented regularizers and the limited generation quality) hinder the existing generative ZSL models from fully bypassing the seen-unseen bias. To tackle the above limitations, for the first time, this work incorporates a new family of generative models (i.e., flow-based models) into ZSL. The proposed Invertible Zero-shot Flow (IZF) learns factorized data embeddings (i.e., the semantic factors and the non-semantic ones) with the forward pass of an invertible flow network, while the reverse pass generates data samples. This procedure theoretically extends conventional generative flows to a conditional scheme. To explicitly solve the bias problem, our model enlarges the seen-unseen distributional discrepancy based on negative sample-based distance measurement. Notably, IZF works flexibly with either a naive Bayesian classifier or a held-out trainable one for zero-shot recognition. Experiments on widely-adopted ZSL benchmarks demonstrate the significant performance gain of IZF over existing methods, in terms of both classic and generalized settings.",

Most recent methods solve this problem based on edge/keypoint detection or semantic segmentation. However, these approaches have shown limited attention on the geometry of the dominant planes and the intersection between them, which has significant impact on room layout. In this work, we propose to incorporate geometric reasoning to deep learning for layout estimation. Our approach learns to infer the depth maps of the dominant planes in the scene by predicting the pixel-level surface parameters, and the layout can be generated by the intersection of the depth maps. Moreover, we present a new dataset with pixel-level depth annotation of dominant planes. It is larger than the existing datasets and contains both cuboid and non-cuboid rooms. Experimental results show that our approach produces considerable performance gains on both 2D and 3D datasets.",

This paper proposes a guessing state for the Guesser, and regards guess as a process with change of guessing state through a dialogue. A guessing state tracking based guess model is therefore proposed. The guessing state is defined as a distribution on objects in the image. With that in hand, two loss functions are defined as supervisions for model training. Early supervision brings supervision to Guesser at early rounds, and incremental supervision brings monotonicity to the guessing state.

Keeping the much lower-dimensional feature embeddings of images reduces the memory footprint significantly. We assume that the model is updated incrementally for new classes as new data becomes available sequentially.This requires adapting the previously stored feature vectors to the updated feature space without having access to the corresponding original training images. Feature adaptation is learned with a multi-layer perceptron, which is trained on feature pairs corresponding to the outputs of the original and updated network on a training image. We validate experimentally that such a transformation generalizes well to the features of the previous set of classes, and maps features to a discriminative subspace in the feature space. As a result, the classifier is optimized jointly over new and old classes without requiring old class images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy in incremental learning benchmarks, while having at least an order of magnitude lower memory footprint compared to image-preserving strategies.",

		"abstract": "Despite impressive progress in object detection over the last years, it is still an open challenge to reliably detect objects across visual domains. Although the topic has attracted attention recently, current approaches all rely on the ability to access a sizable amount of target data for use at training time. This is a heavy assumption, as often it is not possible to anticipate the domain where a detector will be used, nor to access it in advance for data acquisition. Consider for instance the task of monitoring a feed of images from social media: as each image is created and uploaded by a different user, each belongs to a different target domain that is impossible to foresee during training. This paper addresses this setting, presenting an object detection algorithm able to perform unsupervised adaption across domains by using only one target sample, seen at test time. We achieve this by introducing a multi-task architecture that one-shot adapts to any incoming sample by iteratively solving a self-supervised task on it. We further enhance this auxiliary adaptation with cross-task pseudo-labeling. A thorough benchmark analysis against the most recent cross-domain detection methods and a detailed ablation study show the advantage of our method, which sets the state-of-the-art in the defined one-shot scenario.",

To suppressing the impact of mislabeled data, this paper proposes a conceptually simple yet efficient training block, termed as Attentive Feature Mixup (AFM), which allows paying more attention to clean samples and less to mislabeled ones via sample interactions in small groups. Specifically, this plug-and-play AFM first leverages a group-to-attend module to construct groups and assign attention weights for group-wise samples, and then uses a mixup module with the attention weights to interpolate massive noisy-suppressed samples. The AFM has several appealing benefits for noise-robust deep learning. (i) It does not rely on any assumptions and extra clean subset. (ii) With massive interpolations, the ratio of useless samples is reduced dramatically compared to the original noisy ratio. (iii) It jointly optimizes the interpolation weights with classifiers, suppressing the influence of mislabeled data via low attention weights. (iv) It partially inherits the vicinal risk minimization of mixup to alleviate over-fitting while improves it by sampling fewer feature-target vectors around mislabeled data from the mixup vicinal distribution.

Specifically, the CDGC module takes the coarse segmentation result as class mask to extract node features for graph construction and performs dynamic graph convolutions on the constructed graph to learn the feature aggregation and weight allocation. Then the refined feature and the original feature are fused to get the final prediction.

Therefore, we propose a new framework named Character-Preserving Coherent Story Visualization (CP-CSV) to tackle the challenges.

		"title": "Tensor Low-Rank Reconstruction for Semantic Segmentation",
		"abstract": "Context information plays an indispensable role in the success of semantic segmentation. Recently, non-local self-attention based methods are proved to be effective for context information collection. Since desired context consists of spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions, the 3D representation is an appropriate formulation. However, these non-local methods describe 3D context information based on a 2D similarity matrix, where space compression may lead to channel-wise attention missing. An alternative is to model the contextual information directly without compression. However, this effort confronts a fundamental difficulty, namely the high-rank property of context information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to model the 3D context representations,which not only avoids the space compression, but also tackles the high-rank difficulty. Here, inspired by tensor canonical-polyadic decomposition theory (i.e, a high-rank tensor can be expressed as a combination of rank-1 tensors.), we design a low-rank-to-high-rank con-text reconstruction framework (i.e., RecoNet). Specifically, we first introduce the tensor generation module (TGM), which generates a number of rank-1 tensors to capture fragments of context feature. Then we use these rank-1 tensors to recover the high-rank context features through our proposed tensor reconstruction module (TRM). Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art on various public datasets. Additionally, our proposed method has more than 100 times less computational cost compared with conventional non-local-based methods.",

Hence, an effective method to leverage such data would significantly reduce the need of human annotations.

We also develop a parameter-free dynamic dual aggregation learning strategy to adaptively integrate the two components in a progressive joint training manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDAG outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under various settings.",

		"abstract": "Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is an important task for understanding human activity. Graph structure is appropriate to denote the HOIs in the scene. Since there is an subordination between human and object---human play subjective role and object play objective role in HOI, the relations between homogeneous entities and heterogeneous entities in the scene should also not be equally the same. However, previous graph models regard human and object as the same kind of nodes and do not consider that the messages are not equally the same between different entities. In this work, we address such a problem for HOI task by proposing a heterogeneous graph network that models humans and objects as different kinds of nodes and incorporates intra-class messages between homogeneous nodes and inter-class messages between heterogeneous nodes. In addition, a graph attention mechanism based on the intra-class context and inter-class context is exploited to improve the learning. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets V-COCO and HICO-DET verify the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate the importance to extract intra-class and inter-class messages which are not equally the same in HOI detection.",

		"title": "Zero-Shot Image Super-Resolution with Depth Guided Internal Degradation Learning",
		"abstract": "In the past few years, we have witnessed the great progress of image super-resolution (SR) thanks to the power of deep learning. However, a major limitation of the current image SR approaches is that they assume a pre-determined degradation model or kernel, e.g. bicubic, controls the image degradation process. This makes them easily fail to generalize in a real-world or non-ideal environment since the degradation model of an unseen image may not obey the pre-determined kernel used when training the SR model. In this work, we present a simple yet effective zero-shot image super-resolution model. Our zero-shot SR model learns an image-specific super-resolution network (SRN) from a low-resolution input image alone, without relying on external training sets. To circumvent the difficulty caused by the unknown internal degradation model of an image, we propose to learn an image-specific degradation simulation network (DSN) together with our image-specific SRN. Specifically, we exploit the depth information, naturally indicating the scales of local image patches, of an image to extract the unpaired high/low-resolution patch collection to train our networks. According to the benchmark test on four datasets with depth labels or estimated depth maps, our proposed depth guided degradation model learning based image super-resolution (DGDML-SR) achieves visually pleasing results and can outperform the state-of-the-arts in perceptual metrics.",

We propose to precondition the Richardson solver using approximate inverse filters of the (known) blur and natural image prior kernels. Using convolutions instead of a generic linear preconditioner allows extremely efficient parameter sharing across the image, and leads to significant gains in accuracy and/or speed compared to classical FFT and conjugate-gradient methods. More importantly, the proposed architecture is easily adapted to learning both the preconditioner and the proximal operator using CNN embeddings. This yields a simple and efficient algorithm for non-blind image deblurring which is fully interpretable, can be learned end to end, and whose accuracy matches or exceeds the state of the art, quite significantly, in the non-uniform case.",

A typical pipeline for this problem is first to adopt class activation maps (CAM) with image-level labels to generate pseudo-masks (a.k.a. seeds) and then use them for training segmentation models. The main difficulty is that seeds are usually sparse and incomplete. Related works typically try to alleviate this problem by adopting many bells and whistles to enhance the seeds. Instead of struggling to refine a single seed, we propose a novel approach to alleviate the inaccurate seed problem by leveraging the segmentation model's robustness to learn from multiple seeds. We managed to generate many different seeds for each image, which are different estimates of the underlying ground truth. The segmentation model simultaneously exploits these seeds to learn and automatically decides the confidence of each seed. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC 2012 demonstrate the advantage of this multi-seeds strategy over previous state-of-the-art.",

The proposed model consists of two sub-models parameterized by neural networks: (1) a saliency predictor that maps input images to clean saliency maps, and (2) a noise generator, which is a latent variable model that produces noises from Gaussian latent vectors. The whole model that represents noisy labels is a sum of the two sub-models. The goal of training the model is to estimate the parameters of both sub-models, and simultaneously infer the corresponding latent vector of each noisy label. We propose to train the model by using an alternating back-propagation (ABP) algorithm, which alternates the following two steps: (1) learning back-propagation for estimating the parameters of two sub-models by gradient ascent, and (2) inferential back-propagation for inferring the latent vectors of training noisy examples by Langevin Dynamics. To prevent the network from converging to trivial solutions, we utilize an edge-aware smoothness loss to regularize hidden saliency maps to have similar structures as their corresponding images. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

While advanced models are proposed for image restoration (i.e., background image generation), they regard rain streaks with the same properties as background rather than transmission medium. As vapors (i.e., rain streaks accumulation or fog-like rain) are conveyed in the transmission map to model the veiling effect, the fusion of rain streaks and vapors do not naturally reflect the rain image formation. In this work, we reformulate rain streaks as transmission medium together with vapors to model rain imaging. We propose an encoder-decoder CNN named as SNet to learn the transmission map of rain streaks. As rain streaks appear with various shapes and directions, we use ShuffleNet units within SNet to capture their anisotropic representations. As vapors are brought by rain streaks, we propose a VNet containing spatial pyramid pooling (SSP) to predict the transmission map of vapors in multi-scales based on that of rain streaks. Meanwhile, we use an encoder CNN named ANet to estimate atmosphere light. The SNet, VNet, and ANet are jointly trained to predict transmission maps and atmosphere light for rain image restoration.

		"title": "Is Sharing of Egocentric Video Giving Away Your Biometric Signature",
		"abstract": "Easy availability of wearable egocentric cameras, and the sense of privacy propagated by the fact that the wearer is never seen in the captured videos, has led to a tremendous rise in public sharing of such videos. Unlike hand-held cameras, egocentric cameras are harnessed on the wearer’s head, which makes it possible to track the wearer’s head motion by observing optical flow in the egocentric videos. In this work, we create a novel kind of privacy attack by extracting the wearer’s gait profile, a well known biometric signature, from such optical flow in the egocentric videos. We demonstrate strong wearer recognition capabilities based on extracted gait features, an unprecedented and critical weakness completely absent in hand-held videos. We demonstrate the following attack scenarios: (1) In a closed-set scenario, we show that it is possible to recognize the wearer of an egocentric video with an accuracy of more than 92.5% on the benchmark video dataset. (2) In an open-set setting, when the system has not seen the camera wearer even once during the training, we show that it is still possible to identify that the two egocentric videos have been captured by the same wearer with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of less than 14.35%. (3) We show that it is possible to extract gait signature even if only sparse optical flow and no other scene information from egocentric video is available. We demonstrate the accuracy of more than 84% for wearer recognition with only global optical flow. (4) While the first person to first person matching does not give us access to the wearer’s face, we show that it is possible to match the extracted gait features against the one obtained from a third person view such as a surveillance camera looking at the wearer in a completely different background at a different time. In essence, our work indicates that sharing one’s egocentric video should be treated as giving away one’s biometric identity and recommend much more oversight before sharing of egocentric videos.

Some recent works introduce multi-teacher distillation to provide more supervision to the student network. However, the effectiveness of multi-teacher distillation methods are accompanied by costly computation resources. To tackle with both the efficiency and the effectiveness of knowledge distillation, we introduce the feature aggregation to imitate the multi-teacher distillation in the single-teacher distillation framework by extracting informative supervision from multiple teacher feature maps. Specifically, we introduce DFA, a two-stage Differentiable Feature Aggregation search method that motivated by DARTS in neural architecture search, to efficiently find the aggregations. In the first stage, DFA formulates the searching problem as a bi-level optimization and leverages a novel bridge loss, which consists of a student-to-teacher path and a teacher-to-student path, to find appropriate feature aggregations. The two paths act as two players against each other, trying to optimize the unified architecture parameters to the opposite directions while guaranteeing both expressivity and learnability of the feature aggregation simultaneously. In the second stage, DFA performs knowledge distillation with the derived feature aggregation. Experimental results show that DFA outperforms existing methods on CIFAR-100 and CINIC-10 datasets under various teacher-student settings, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of the design.",

This task is challenging due to the small sample size and pixel coverage of the anomaly in real-world scenarios. Most prior works need to use anomalous training images to compute a class-specific threshold to localize anomalies. Without the need of anomalous training images, we propose Convolutional Adversarial Variational autoencoder with Guided Attention (CAVGA), which localizes the anomaly with a convolutional latent variable to preserve the spatial information. In the unsupervised setting, we propose an attention expansion loss where we encourage CAVGA to focus on all normal regions in the image. Furthermore, in the weakly-supervised setting we propose a complementary guided attention loss, where we encourage the attention map to focus on all normal regions while minimizing the attention map corresponding to anomalous regions in the image.

However, it is difficult to use these learned semantics for real image editing. A common practice of feeding a real image to a trained GAN generator is to invert it back to a latent code. However, existing inversion methods typically focus on reconstructing the target image by pixel values yet fail to land the inverted code in the semantic domain of the original latent space. As a result, the reconstructed image cannot well support semantic editing through varying the inverted code. To solve this problem, we propose an in-domain GAN inversion approach, which not only faithfully reconstructs the input image but also ensures the inverted code to be semantically meaningful for editing. We first learn a novel domain-guided encoder to project a given image to the native latent space of GANs. We then propose domain-regularized optimization by involving the encoder as a regularizer to fine-tune the code produced by the encoder and better recover the target image.

		"abstract": "Depth maps contain geometric clues for assisting Salient Object Detection (SOD). In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Weighting (CMW) strategy to encourage comprehensive interactions between RGB and depth channels for RGB-D SOD. Specifically, three RGB-depth interaction modules, named CMW-L, CMW-M and CMW-H, are developed to deal with respectively low-, middle- and high-level cross-modal information fusion. These modules use Depth-to-RGB Weighing (DW) and RGB-to-RGB Weighting (RW) to allow rich cross-modal and cross-scale interactions among feature layers generated by different network blocks. To effectively train the proposed Cross-Modal Weighting Network (CMWNet), we design a composite loss function that summarizes the errors between intermediate predictions and ground truth over different scales. With all these novel components working together, CMWNet effectively fuses information from RGB and depth channels, and meanwhile explores object localization and details across scales. Thorough evaluations demonstrate CMWNet consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods on seven popular benchmarks.",

		"title": "Open-set Adversarial Defense",
		"abstract": "Open-set recognition and adversarial defense study two key aspects of deep learning that are vital for real-world deployment. The objective of open-set recognition is to identify samples from open-set classes during testing, while adversarial defense aims to defend the network against images with imperceptible adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we show that open-set recognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we show that adversarial defense mechanisms trained on known classes do not generalize well to open-set samples. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need of an Open-Set Adversarial Defense (OSAD) mechanism. This paper proposes an Open-Set Defense Network (OSDN) as a solution to the OSAD problem. The proposed network uses an encoder with feature-denoising layers coupled with a classifier to learn a noise-free latent feature representation. Two techniques are employed to obtain an informative latent feature space with the objective of improving open-set performance. First, a decoder is used to ensure that clean images can be reconstructed from the obtained latent features. Then, self-supervision is used to ensure that the latent features are informative enough to carry out an auxiliary task. We introduce a testing protocol to evaluate OSAD performance and show the effectiveness of the proposed method in multiple object classification datasets. The implementation code of the proposed method is available at: \\href{https://github.com/rshaojimmy/ECCV2020-OSAD}{https://github.com/rshaojimmy/ECCV2020-OSAD}.",

Unfortunately the generation of such data often requires experts to carefully design sampling procedures that guarantee creation of realistic scenes. These sampling procedures typically require experts to specify certain structural aspects such as scene layout information. This is often hard to design, as scenes are generally highly complex and diverse. In this paper, we propose a generative model of synthetic scenes that reduces the distribution gap between the scene structure of generated scenes and a real target image dataset. Importantly, since labeling scene structures for real images is incredibly cumbersome, our method operates without any ground truth structure information for real data. Experiments on two synthetic datasets and a real driving dataset show that the method successfully bridges the distribution gap of discrete structural features between real and generated images.",

However, such information is hard to obtain, and thus very few datasets support it. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework for annotating 3D object geometry from both point cloud data and RGB imagery. The key idea behind our approach is to exploit strong priors that humans have about the 3D world in order to interactively annotate complete 3D shapes. Our framework targets a wide pool of annotators, i.e. naive users without artistic or graphics expertise. In particular, we introduce two simple-to-use interaction modules. First, we make an automatic guess of the 3D shape and allow the user to provide feedback about large errors by drawing scribbles in desired 2D views. Next, we aim to correct minor errors, in which users drag and drop 3D mesh vertices, assisted by a neural interactive module implemented as a Graph Convolutional Network. Experimentally, we show that only a few user interactions are needed to produce good quality 3D shapes on popular benchmarks such as ShapeNet, Pix3D, and ScanNet. We implement our framework as a web service and conduct a user study, where we show that user annotated data using our method effectively facilitates real-world learning tasks.

In this work, we address this gap by proposing a new technique for regression of human parametric model that is explicitly informed by the known hierarchical structure, including joint interdependencies of the model. This results in a strong prior-informed design of the regressor architecture and an associated hierarchical optimization that is flexible to be used in conjunction with the current standard frameworks for 3D human mesh recovery. We demonstrate these aspects by means of extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, showing how our proposed new design outperforms several existing and popular methods, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

		"title": "Accurate RGB-D Salient Object Detection via Collaborative Learning",
		"abstract": "Benefiting from the spatial cues embedded in depth images, recent progress on RGB-D saliency detection shows impressive ability on some challenge scenarios. However, there are still two limitations. One hand is that the pooling and upsampling operations in FCNs might cause blur object boundaries. On the other hand, using an additional depth-network to extract depth features might lead to high computation and storage cost. The reliance on depth inputs during testing also limits the practical applications of current RGB-D models. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative learning framework where edge, depth and saliency are leveraged in a more efficient way, which solves those problems tactfully. The explicitly extracted edge information goes together with saliency to give more emphasis to the salient regions and object boundaries. Depth and saliency learning is innovatively integrated into the high-level feature learning process in a mutual-benefit manner. This strategy enables the network to be free of using extra depth networks and depth inputs to make inference. To this end, it makes our model more lightweight, faster and more versatile.

Addressing this disparity, we introduce a new optimization procedure, which allows training for 3D detection with raw 3D scans while using as little as 5\\,\\% of the object labels and still achieve comparable performance. Our optimization uses two networks. A scene network maps an entire 3D scene to a set of 3D object centers. As we assume the scene not to be labeled by centers, no classic loss, such as Chamfer can be used to train it. Instead, we use another network to emulate the loss. This loss network is trained on a small labeled subset and maps a non-centered 3D object in the presence of distractions to its own center. This function is very similar -- and hence can be used instead of -- the gradient the supervised loss would provide. Our evaluation documents competitive fidelity at a much lower level of supervision, respectively higher quality at comparable supervision.

Pre-trained detectors applied to unlabeled dataset always suffer from the difference of dataset distribution, also called domain shift. Domain adaptation for object detection tries to adapt the detector from labeled datasets to unlabeled ones for better performance. In this paper, we are the first to reveal that the region proposal network (RPN) and region proposal classifier (RPC) in the endemic two-stage detectors (e.g., Faster RCNN) demonstrate significantly different transferability when facing large domain gap. The region classifier shows preferable performance but is limited without RPN's high-quality proposals while simple alignment in the backbone network is not effective enough for RPN adaptation. We delve into the consistency and the difference of RPN and RPC, treat them individually and leverage high-confidence output of one as mutual guidance to train the other.

		"abstract": "For large-scale vision tasks in biomedical images, the labeled data is often limited to train effective deep models. Active learning is a common solution, where a query suggestion method selects representative unlabeled samples for annotation, and the new labels are used to improve the base model. However, most query suggestion models optimize their learnable parameters only on the limited labeled data and consequently become less effective for the more challenging unlabeled data. To tackle this, we propose a two-stream active query suggestion approach. In addition to the supervised feature extractor, we introduce an unsupervised one optimized on all raw images to capture diverse image features, which can later be improved by fine-tuning on new labels. As a use case, we build an end-to-end active learning framework with our query suggestion method for 3D synapse detection and mitochondria segmentation in connectomics.

		"abstract": "How can we teach robots or virtual assistants to gesture naturally? Can we go further and adapt the gesturing style to follow a specific speaker? Gestures that are naturally timed with corresponding speech during human communication are called co-speech gestures. A key challenge, called gesture style transfer, is to learn a model that generates these gestures for a speaking agent 'A' in the gesturing style of a target speaker 'B'. A secondary goal is to simultaneously learn to generate co-speech gestures for multiple speakers while remembering what is unique about each speaker. We call this challenge style preservation. In this paper, we propose a new model, named Mix-StAGE, which trains a single model for multiple speakers while learning unique style embeddings for each speaker's gestures in an end-to-end manner. A novelty of Mix-StAGE is to learn a mixture of generative models which allows for conditioning on the unique gesture style of each speaker. As Mix-StAGE disentangles style and content of gestures, gesturing styles for the same input speech can be altered by simply switching the style embeddings. Mix-StAGE also allows for style preservation when learning simultaneously from multiple speakers. We also introduce a new dataset, Pose-Audio-Transcript-Style (PATS), designed to study gesture generation and style transfer. Our proposed Mix-StAGE model significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach for gesture generation and provides a path towards performing gesture style transfer across multiple speakers.

We construct the first movie-trailer dataset, and the proposed Co-Attention assisted ranking network shows superior performance even over the supervised\footnote{The term \"\"supervised\"\" refers to the approach with access to the manual ground-truth annotations for training.} approach. The effectiveness of our Contrastive Attention module is also demonstrated by the performance improvement over the state-of-the-art on the public benchmarks.",

		"abstract": "The abundance of multimodal data (e.g. social media posts) has inspired interest in cross-modal retrieval methods. Popular approaches rely on a variety of metric learning losses, which prescribe what the proximity of image and text should be, in the learned space. However, most prior methods have focused on the case where image and text convey redundant information; in contrast, real-world image-text pairs convey complementary information with little overlap. Further, images in news articles and media portray topics in a visually diverse fashion; thus, we need to take special care to ensure a meaningful image representation. We propose novel within-modality losses which encourage semantic coherency in both the text and image subspaces, which does not necessarily align with visual coherency. Our method ensures that not only are paired images and texts close, but the expected image-image and text-text relationships are also observed. Our approach improves the results of cross-modal retrieval on four datasets compared to five baselines.",

Our best single model outperforms prior published work (including model ensembles) by more than 1% absolute on NDCG and MRR.Next, we find that additional finetuning using \"\"dense\"\" annotations in VisDial leads to even higher NDCG -- more than 10% over our base model -- but hurts MRR -- more than 17% below our base model!

		"title": "Learning to Generate Grounded Visual Captions without Localization Supervision",
		"abstract": "When automatically generating a sentence description for an image or video, it often remains unclear how well the generated caption is grounded, that is whether the model uses the correct image regions to output particular words, or if the model is hallucinating based on priors in the dataset and/or the language model. The most common way of relating image regions with words in caption models is through an attention mechanism over the regions that are used as input to predict the next word. The model must therefore learn to predict the attentional weights without knowing the word it should localize. This is difficult to train without grounding supervision since recurrent models can propagate past information and there is no explicit signal to force the captioning model to properly ground the individual decoded words. In this work, we help the model to achieve this via a novel cyclical training regimen that forces the model to localize each word in the image after the sentence decoder generates it, and then reconstruct the sentence from the localized image region(s) to match the ground-truth. Our proposed framework only requires learning one extra fully-connected layer (the localizer), a layer that can be removed at test time. We show that our model significantly improves grounding accuracy without relying on grounding supervision or introducing extra computation during inference, for both image and video captioning tasks.

The key component of our method is a shared latent space to encode appearance-invariant structure information of both domains, which generates realistic renderings conditioned by extra appearance inputs. This is achieved by domain-specific pre-disentangled structure representation, partially shared domain encoder layers and a structure discriminator.

		"title": "JNR: Joint-based Neural Rig Representation for Compact 3D Face Modeling",
		"abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learn a 3D face model using a joint-based face rig and a neural skinning network. Thanks to the joint-based representation, our model enjoys some significant advantages over prior blendshape-based models. First, it is very compact such that we are orders of magnitude smaller while still keeping strong modeling capacity. Second, because each joint has its semantic meaning, interactive facial geometry editing is made easier and more intuitive. Third, through skinning, our model supports adding mouth interior and eyes, as well as accessories (hair, eye glasses, etc.) in a simpler, more accurate and principled way. We argue that because the human face is highly structured and topologically consistent, it does not need to be learned entirely from data. Instead we can leverage prior knowledge in the form of a human-designed 3D face rig to reduce the data dependency, and learn a compact yet strong face model from only a small dataset (less than one hundred 3D scans). To further improve the modeling capacity, we train a skinning weight generator through adversarial learning. Experiments on fitting high-quality 3D scans (both neutral and expressive), noisy depth images, and RGB images demonstrate that its modeling capacity is on-par with state-of-the-art face models, such as FLAME and Facewarehouse, even though the model is 10 to 20 times smaller. This suggests broad value in both graphics and vision applications on mobile and edge devices.",

Yet, this is a challenging task due to the diversity of spoof types and the lack of ground truth in spoof traces. This work designs a novel adversarial learning framework to disentangle the spoof traces from input faces as a hierarchical combination of patterns at multiple scales. With the disentangled spoof traces, we unveil the live counterpart of the original spoof face, and further synthesize realistic new spoof faces after a proper geometric correction.

		"abstract": "Autonomous vehicles operate in a dynamic environment, where the speed with which a vehicle can perceive and react impacts the safety and efficacy of the system. LiDAR provides a central and prominent sensory modality that informs many existing perceptual systems including object detection, segmentation, motion estimation and action recognition. The latency for perceptual system based on point cloud data can be dominated by the amount of time for a complete rotational scan (e.g. 100 ms). This built-in data capture latency is artificial, and based on treating the point cloud as a camera image in order to leverage camera-inspired architectures. However, unlike CCD camera sensors, most LiDAR point cloud data is natively a {\\it streaming} data source in which laser reflections are sequentially recorded based on the rotational angle of the laser beam. In this work, we explore how to build an object detector that removes this artificial latency constraint, and instead operates on native streaming data in order to significantly reduce latency. This approach has the added benefit of reducing the peak computational burden on inference hardware by spreading the computation over the complete scan sequence. We demonstrate a family of streaming detection systems based on sequential modeling through a series of modifications to the traditional object detection meta-architecture. We highlight how this model may achieve competitive if not superior predictive performance with state-of-the-art, traditional non-streaming detection systems while achieving significant latency gains (e.g. 1/15'th - 1/3'rd of peak latency). Our results show that operating on LiDAR data in its native streaming formulation offers several advantages for self driving object detection -- advantages that we hope will be useful for any LiDAR perception system where minimizing latency is critical for safe and efficient operation.",

The embedding makes it possible to determine whether two heavily-overlapping boxes belong to the same object in the physical world.

Our method is based on generating synthetic image grids that differ along specific attributes while leaving other attributes constant.

Due to the complex structure, point sets are distributed off-balance and diversely, appearing as both category and pattern imbalance. It has been proved that deep networks can easily forget the non-dominant cases during training, which influences the model generalization and leads to unsatisfactory performance. Although re-weighting on instances may reduce the influence, it is hard to find a balance between the dominant and the non-dominant cases. To tackle the above issue, we propose a memory-augmented network that learns and memorizes the representative prototypes that encode both geometry and semantic information. The prototypes are shared by diverse 3D points and recorded in a universal memory module. During training, the memory slots are dynamically associated with both dominant and non-dominant cases, alleviating the forgetting issue. In testing, the distorted observations and rare cases can thus be augmented by retrieving the stored prototypes, leading to better generalization.

We then minimize the discrepancy between an image and its ground-truth layout in the learned embedding space. We employ a metric model and a layout encoder to map the RGB images and the ground-truth layouts to the embedding space, respectively, and a layout decoder to map the embeddings to the corresponding layouts, where the whole framework is trained in an end-to-end manner. We perform experiments on the widely used Hedau and LSUN datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

		"title": "Adaptive Task Sampling for Meta-Learning",
		"abstract": "Meta-learning methods have been extensively studied and applied in computer vision, especially for few-shot classification tasks. The key idea of meta-learning for few-shot classification is to mimic the few-shot situations faced at test time by randomly sampling classes in meta-training data to construct few-shot tasks for episodic training. While a rich line of work focuses solely on how to extract meta-knowledge across tasks, we exploit the complementary problem on how to generate informative tasks. We argue that the randomly sampled tasks could be sub-optimal and uninformative (e.g., the task of classifying ``dog\"\" from ``laptop\"\" is often trivial) to the meta-learner. In this paper, we propose an adaptive task sampling method to improve the generalization performance. Unlike instance based sampling, task based sampling is much more challenging due to the implicit definition of the task in each episode. Therefore, we accordingly propose a greedy class-pair based sampling method, which selects difficult tasks according to class-pair potentials. We evaluate our adaptive task sampling method on two few-shot classification benchmarks, and it achieves consistent improvements across different feature backbones, meta-learning algorithms and datasets.",

		"abstract": "Deep learning-based medical image registration and segmentation joint models utilize the complementarity (augmentation data or weakly supervised data from registration, region constraints from segmentation) to bring mutual improvement in complex scene and few-shot situation. However, further adoption of the joint models are hindered: 1) the diversity of augmentation data is reduced limiting the further enhancement of segmentation, 2) misaligned regions in weakly supervised data disturb the training process, 3) lack of label-based region constraints in few-shot situation limits the registration performance. We propose a novel Deep Complementary Joint Model (DeepRS) for complex scene registration and few-shot segmentation. We embed a perturbation factor in the registration to increase the activity of deformation thus maintaining the augmentation data diversity. We take a pixel-wise discriminator to extract alignment confidence maps which highlight aligned regions in weakly supervised data so the misaligned regions' disturbance will be suppressed via weighting. The outputs from segmentation model are utilized to implement deep-based region constraints thus relieving the label requirements and bringing fine registration. Extensive experiments on the CT dataset of MM-WHS 2017 Challenge show great advantages of our DeepRS that outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models.",

To address this challenge, we propose an iterative inpainting method with a feedback mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a deep generative model which not only outputs an inpainting result but also a corresponding confidence map. Using this map as feedback, it progressively fills the hole by trusting only high-confidence pixels inside the hole at each iteration and focuses on the remaining pixels in the next iteration. As it reuses partial predictions from the previous iterations as known pixels, this process gradually improves the result. In addition, we propose a guided upsampling network to enable generation of high-resolution inpainting results. We achieve this by extending the Contextual Attention module to borrow high-resolution feature patches in the input image. Furthermore, to mimic real object removal scenarios, we collect a large object mask dataset and synthesize more realistic training data that better simulates user inputs.

Many techniques for detecting pupil centers with error range of iris radius have been developed, but few techniques have precise performance with error range of pupil radius. In addition, the conventional methods rarely guarantee real-time pupil center detection in a general-purpose computer environment due to high complexity. Thus, we propose more accurate pupil center detection by improving the representation quality of the network in charge of pupil center detection. This is realized by representation learning based on mutual information. Also, the latency of the entire system is greatly reduced by using non-local block and self-attention block with large receptive field, which makes it accomplish real-time operation.

However, it performs poorly on contextless texts (e.g., random character sequences) which is unacceptable in most of real application scenarios. In this paper, we first deeply investigate the decoding process of the decoder. We empirically find that a representative character-level sequence decoder utilizes not only context information but also positional information. Contextual information, which the existing approaches heavily rely on, causes the problem of attention drift. To suppress such side-effect, we propose a novel position enhancement branch, and dynamically fuse its outputs with those of the decoder attention module for scene text recognition. Specifically, it contains a position aware module to enable the encoder to output feature vectors encoding their own spatial positions, and an attention module to estimate glimpses using the positional clue (i.e., the current decoding time step) only. The dynamic fusion is conducted for more robust feature via an element-wise gate mechanism. Theoretically, our proposed method, dubbed RobustScanner, decodes individual characters with dynamic ratio between context and positional clues, and utilizes more positional ones when the decoding sequences with scarce context, and thus is robust and practical. Empirically, it has achieved new state-of-the-art results on popular regular and irregular text recognition benchmarks while without much performance drop on contextless benchmarks, validating its robustness in both contextual and contextless application scenarios.",

Recent studies discover that matrix normalization is vital for improving the performance of bilinear pooling. Nevertheless, traditional matrix square-root or logarithm normalization methods need singular value decomposition (SVD), which is not well suited in the GPU platform, limiting its efficiency in training and inference. To boost the efficiency in the GPU platform, recent methods rely on Newton-Schulz (NS) iteration to approximate the matrix square-root. Despite NS iteration is GPU-friendly, it takes several times matrix-matrix multiplications, which is still expensive in computation. Besides, the proposed RUN is much simpler than NS iteration and thus much easier for implementation in practice. Meanwhile, NS iteration can not well support the compact bilinear feature obtained from tensor sketch or random projection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a rank-1 update normalization (RUN), which only needs matrix-vector multiplications and thus is significantly more efficient than NS iteration using matrix-matrix multiplications. Moreover, our RUN readily supports the normalization on compact bilinear features, making it more flexible to be deployed compared with NS iteration. The proposed RUN is differentiable and can be plugged in a neural network for an end-to-end training. Comprehensive experiments on four public benchmarks show that, for the full bilinear pooling, the proposed RUN achieves comparable accuracies with a $330 imes$ speedup over NS iteration. For the compact bilinear pooling, our RUN achieves comparable accuracies with a $5400 imes$ speedup over SVD-based normalization.",

However, localization maps extracted from classification networks are often not accurate due to the lack of fine pixel-level supervision. In this paper, we propose to leverage pixel-level similarities across different objects for learning more accurate object locations in a complementary way. Particularly, two kinds of constraints are proposed to prompt the consistency of object features within the same categories. The first constraint is to learn the stochastic feature consistency among discriminative pixels that are randomly sampled from different images within a batch. The discriminative information embedded in one image can be leveraged to benefit its counterpart with inter-image communication. The second constraint is to learn the global consistency of object features throughout the entire dataset. We learn a feature center for each category and realize the global feature consistency by forcing the object features to approach class-specific centers. The global centers are actively updated with the training process. The two constraints can benefit each other to learn consistent pixel-level features within the same categories, and finally improve the quality of localization maps. We conduct extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks, i.e., ILSVRC and CUB-200-2011.

Specifically, a phase estimation network is introduced for the input single image, and the gait cycle reconstruction network exploits the estimated phase to mitigate the dependence of an encoded feature on the phase of that single image. This is called phase-aware gait cycle reconstructor (PA-GCR). In the training phase, the PA-GCR and recognition network are simultaneously optimized to achieve a good trade-off between reconstruction and recognition accuracies. Experiments on three gait datasets demonstrate the significant performance improvement of this method.",

Existing approaches can use a unified model to achieve translations between all the visual domains. However, their outcomes are far from satisfying when there are large domain variations.

To select informative samples, we dynamically estimate sample importance during the training of Generative Adversarial Networks, presenting Informative Sample Mining Network. We theoretically analyze the relationship between the sample importance and the prediction of the global optimal discriminator. Then a practical importance estimation function for general conditions is derived. In addition, we propose a novel multi-stage sample training scheme to reduce sample hardness while preserving sample informativeness.

Consequently, the feature transform is performed by a rotation that respects the spherical data distributions.

		"abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) has achieved great success thanks to the fast development of deep neural networks (DNN). On the other hand, the data augmentation, as one of the major tricks for DNN, has been widely used in many computer vision tasks. However, there are few works studying the data augmentation problem for VQA and none of the existing image based augmentation schemes (such as rotation and flipping) can be directly applied to VQA due to its semantic structure -- an $\\langle image, question, answer\rangle$ triplet needs to be maintained correctly. For example, a direction related Question-Answer (QA) pair may not be true if the associated image is rotated or flipped. In this paper, instead of directly manipulating images and questions, we use generated adversarial examples for both images and questions as the augmented data. The augmented examples do not change the visual properties presented in the image as well as the extbf{semantic} meaning of the question, the correctness of the $\\langle image, question, answer\rangle$ is thus still maintained. We then use adversarial learning to train a classic VQA model (BUTD) with our augmented data. We find that we not only improve the overall performance on VQAv2, but also can withstand adversarial attack effectively, compared to the baseline model.

Our unsupervised multi-view CNN branches off two channels which encode the knowledge within each 2D view and the 3D object respectively and also exploits both intra-view and inter-view knowledge of the object. It ends with a new loss layer which formulates the view-object consistency by impelling the two channels to generate consistent classification outcomes. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its superiority over several state-of-the-art methods.

To enhance such capability, we propose an extremely efficient neural architecture search method, named Fast And Diverse (FAD), to better explore the optimal configuration of receptive fields and con-volution types in the sub-networks for one-stage detectors. FAD consists of a designed search space and an efficient architecture search algorithm. The search space contains a rich set of diverse transformations designed specifically for object detection. To cope with the designed search space, a novel search algorithm termed Representation Sharing (RepShare) is proposed to effectively identify the best combinations of the defined transformations. In our experiments, FAD obtains prominent improvements on two types of one-stage detectors with various backbones. In particular, our FAD detector achieves 46.4 AP on MS-COCO (under single-scale testing), outperforming the state-of-the-art detectors, including the most recent NAS-based detectors, Auto-FPN [42] (searched for 16 GPU-days) and NAS-FCOS [39] (28 GPU-days), while significantly reduces the search cost to 0.6 GPU-days.

Naively extending such developments to a 3D setting is a difficult, intractable goal. To this end, we introduce RubiksNet, a new efficient architecture for video action recognition which is based on a proposed learnable 3D spatiotemporal shift operation instead.

Specifically, we generalize the structural risk minimization principle and obtain three criteria for the pairwise supervision acquisition: uncertainty, representativeness and diversity. Accordingly, samples involved in the following training pairs should be labeled: pairs with most uncertain similarity, pairs that minimize the discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data, and pairs which are most different from the annotated data, so that the discriminality and generalization ability of the learned hash codes are significantly strengthened. Moreover, our DH-APS can also be employed as a plug-and-play module for semi-supervised hashing methods to further enhance the performance. Experiments demonstrate that the presented DH-APS achieves the accuracy of supervised hashing methods with only $30\\%$ labeled training samples and improves the semi-supervised binary codes by a sizable margin.",

Specifically, we encode the first fundamental form in a 3 $ imes$ 3 linear transformation matrix $\\mathbf{T}$ for each input point. Such a matrix approximates the augmented Jacobian matrix of a local parameterization that encodes the intrinsic information and builds a one-to-one correspondence between the 2D parametric domain and the 3D tangent plane, so that we can lift the adaptively distributed 2D samples learned from the input to 3D space.

Previous works are restricted in modulating image with a single coefficient. However, real images always contain multiple types of degradation, which cannot be well determined by one coefficient. To make a step forward, this paper presents a new problem setup, called multi-dimension (MD) modulation, which aims at modulating output effects across multiple degradation types and levels. Compared with the previous single-dimension (SD) modulation, the MD is setup to handle multiple degradations adaptively and relief unbalanced learning problem in different degradations. We also propose a deep architecture - CResMD with newly introduced controllable residual connections for multi-dimension modulation. Specifically, we add a controlling variable on the conventional residual connection to allow a weighted summation of input and residual. The values of these weights are generated by another condition network. We further propose a new data sampling strategy based on beta distribution to balance different degradation types and levels. With corrupted image and degradation information as inputs, the network can output the corresponding restored image. By tweaking the condition vector, users can control the output effects in MD space at test time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CResMD achieve excellent performance on both SD and MD modulation tasks.

		"title": "Polysemy Deciphering Network for Human-Object Interaction Detection",
		"abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is important in human-centric scene understanding. Existing works typically assume that the same verb in different HOI categories has similar visual characteristics, while ignoring the diverse semantic meanings of the verb. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Polysemy Deciphering Network (PD-Net), which decodes the visual polysemy of verbs for HOI detection in three ways. First, PD-Net augments human pose and spatial features for HOI detection using language priors, enabling the verb classifiers to receive language hints that reduce the intra-class variation of the same verb. Second, we introduce a novel Polysemy Attention Module (PAM) that guides PD-Net to make decisions based on more important feature types according to the language priors. Finally, the above two strategies are applied to two types of classifiers for verb recognition, i.e., object-shared and object-specific verb classifiers, whose combination further relieves the verb polysemy problem. By deciphering the visual polysemy of verbs, we achieve the best performance on both HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. In particular, PD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 3.81% mAP in the Known-Object evaluation mode of HICO-DET. Code of PD-Net will be released at https://github.com/MuchHair/PD-Net.",

The keys to success lie in the use of cost volume and coarse-to-fine flow inference. However, the matching problem becomes ill-posed when partially occluded or homogeneous regions exist in images. This causes a cost volume to contain outliers and affects the flow decoding from it. Besides, the coarse-to-fine flow inference demands an accurate flow initialization. Ambiguous correspondence yields erroneous flow fields and affects the flow inferences in subsequent levels. In this paper, we introduce LiteFlowNet3, a deep network consisting of two specialized modules, to address the above challenges. (1) We ameliorate the issue of outliers in the cost volume by amending each cost vector through an adaptive modulation prior to the flow decoding. (2) We further improve the flow accuracy by exploring local flow consistency. To this end, each inaccurate optical flow is replaced with an accurate one from a nearby position through a novel warping of the flow field.

The algorithm uses a transformation which transforms a multi-label problem to a 2-label problem on a much larger clique. Earlier algorithms based on this transformation could not handle problems larger than 16 labels on cliques of size 4. The proposed algorithm optimizes the resultant 2-label problem using the submodular polyhedron based Min Norm Point algorithm. The task is challenging because the state space of the transformed problem has a very large number of invalid states. For polyhedral based algorithms the presence of invalid states poses a challenge as apart from numerical instability, the transformation also increases the dimension of the polyhedral space making the straightforward use of known algorithms impractical. The approach reported in this paper allows us to bypass the large costs associated with invalid configurations, resulting in a stable, practical, optimal and efficient inference algorithm that, in our experiments, gives high-quality outputs on problems like pixel-wise object segmentation and stereo matching.",

In computer vision, one particularly popular such technique is that of confidence-based regression, which entails predicting a confidence value for each input-target pair $(x, y)$. While this approach has demonstrated impressive results, it requires important task-dependent design choices, and the predicted confidences lack a natural probabilistic meaning. We address these issues by proposing a general and conceptually simple regression method with a clear probabilistic interpretation. In our proposed approach, we create an energy-based model of the conditional target density $p(y | x)$, using a deep neural network to predict the un-normalized density from $(x, y)$. This model of $p(y | x)$ is trained by directly minimizing the associated negative log-likelihood, approximated using Monte Carlo sampling.

		"title": "Encoding Structure-Texture Relation with P-Net for Anomaly Detection in Retinal Images",
		"abstract": "Anomaly detection in retinal image refers to the identification of abnormality caused by various retinal diseases/lesions, by only leveraging normal images in training phase. Normal images from healthy subjects often have regular structures (e.g., the structured blood vessels in the fundus image, or structured anatomy in optical coherence tomography image). On the contrary, the diseases and lesions often destroy these structures. Motivated by this, we propose to leverage the relation between the image texture and structure to design a deep neural network for anomaly detection. Specifically, we first extract the structure of the retinal images, then we combine both the structure features and the last layer features extracted from original health image to reconstruct the original input healthy image. The image feature provides the texture information and guarantees the uniqueness of the image recovered from the structure. In the end, we further utilize the reconstructed image to extract the structure and measure the difference between structure extracted from original and the reconstructed image. On the one hand, minimizing the reconstruction difference behaves like a regularizer to guarantee that the image is corrected reconstructed. On the other hand, such structure difference can also be used as a metric for normality measurement. The whole network is termed as P-Net because it has a \"\"P\"\" shape. Extensive experiments on RESC dataset and iSee dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach for anomaly detection in retinal images.

However, most of multiple-face prediction works only consider visual information and ignore audio, which is not consistent with the naturalistic scenarios. Several behavioral studies have established that sound influences human attention, especially during the speech turn-taking in multiple-face videos. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate such influences by establishing a large-scale eye-tracking database of Multiple-face Video in Visual-Audio condition (MVVA). Inspired by the findings of our investigation, we propose a novel multi-modal video saliency model consisting of three branches: visual, audio and face. The visual branch takes the RGB frames as the input and encodes them into visual feature maps. The audio and face branches encode the audio signal and multiple cropped faces, respectively. A fusion module is introduced to integrate the information from three modalities, and to generate the final saliency map. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 11 state-of-the-art saliency prediction works. It performs closer to human multi-modal attention.",

The final model was then generated by simply combining the front-view and back-view RGB-D information. However, inferring back-view RGB-D image with high-quality geometric details and plausible texture is not trivial. Our key observation is: Normal maps generally encode much more information of 3D surface details than RGB and depth images. Therefore, learning geometric details from normal maps is superior than other representations. In NormalGAN, an adversarial learning framework conditioned by normal maps is introduced, which is used to not only improve the front-view depth denoising performance, but also infer back-view depth image with surprisingly geometric details. Moreover, for texture recovery, we remove shading information from the front-view RGB image based on the refined normal map, which further improves the quality of the back-view color inference. Results and experiments on both testing data set and real captured data demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.

Motivated by the IoU loss in the axis-aligned 2D object detection which is invariant to the scale, our method jointly optimizes the parameters via the $ extit{RIoU}$ loss. To tackle the uncertainty of convex caused by rotation, a projection operation is defined to estimate the intersection area. The calculation process of $ extit{RIoU}$ and its loss function is robust to the rotation condition and feasible for back-propagation, which only comprises basic numerical operations.

However, the usage of non-local blocks may also introduce new threats to computer vision systems. Therefore, it is important to study the threats caused by non-local blocks before directly applying them to commercial systems. In this paper, two new threats named disappearing attack and appearing attack against object detectors with a non-local block are investigated. The former aims at misleading an object detector with a non-local block such that it is unable to detect a target object category while the latter aims at misleading the object detector such that it detects a predefined object category, which is not present in images. Different from the existing attacks against object detectors, these threats are able to be performed in long range cases. This means that the target object and the universal adversarial patches learned from the proposed algorithms can have long distance between them. To examine the threats, digital and physical experiments are conducted on Faster R-CNN with a non-local block and 6331 images from 56 videos. The experiments show that the universal patches are able to mislead the detector with greater probabilities.

		"abstract": "Recent generative adversarial network (GAN) based methods (e.g., CycleGAN) are prone to fail at preserving image-objects in image-to-image translation, which reduces their practicality on tasks such as domain adaptation. Some frameworks have been proposed to adopt a segmentation network as the auxiliary regularization to prevent the content distortion. However, all of them require extra pixel-wise annotations, which is difficult to fulfill in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN (namely OP-GAN) to address the problem, which involves a self-supervised module to enforce the image content consistency during image-to-image translations without any extra annotations. We evaluate the proposed OP-GAN on three publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our OP-GAN can yield visually plausible translated images and significantly improve the semantic segmentation accuracy in different domain adaptation scenarios with off-the-shelf deep learning networks such as PSPNet and U-Net.",

In this paper we address motion segmentation in multiple images by combining partial results coming from triplets of images, which are obtained by fitting a number of trifocal tensors to correspondences. We exploit the fact that the trifocal tensor is a stronger model than the fundamental matrix, as it provides fewer but more reliable matches over three images than fundamental matrices provide over the two. We also consider an alternative solution which merges partial results coming from both triplets and pairs of images, showing the strength of three-frame segmentation in a combination with two-frame segmentation. Our real experiments on standard as well as new datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed approaches when compared to previous techniques.",

In this paper, we present an active learning framework which enables accurate crowd counting with limited supervision: given a small labeling budget, instead of randomly selecting images to annotate, we first introduce an active labeling strategy to annotate the most informative images in the dataset and learn the counting model upon them. The process is repeated such that in every cycle we select the samples that are diverse in crowd density and dissimilar to previous selections. In the last cycle when the labeling budget is met, the large amount of unlabeled data are also utilized: a distribution classifier is introduced to align the labeled data with unlabeled data; furthermore, we propose to mix up the distribution labels and latent representations of data in the network to particularly improve the distribution alignment in-between training samples. We follow the popular density estimation pipeline for crowd counting. Extensive experiments are conducted on standard benchmarks i.e. ShanghaiTech, UCF CC 50, MAll, TRANCOS, and DCC.

		"abstract": "The 2D virtual try-on task has recently attracted a great interest from the research community, for its direct potential applications in online shopping as well as for its inherent and non-addressed scientific challenges. This task requires fitting an in-shop cloth image on the image of a person, which is highly challenging because it involves cloth warping, image compositing, and synthesizing. Casting virtual try-on into a supervised task faces a difficulty: available datasets are composed of pairs of pictures (cloth, person wearing the cloth). Thus, we have no access to ground-truth when the cloth on the person changes. State-of-the-art models solve this by masking the cloth information on the person with both a human parser and a pose estimator. Then, image synthesis modules are trained to reconstruct the person image from a masked person image and a cloth image. This procedure has several caveats: firstly, human parsers are prone to errors; secondly, it is a costly pre-processing step, which also has to be applied at inference time; finally, it makes the task harder than it is since the mask covers information that should be kept such as hands or accessories. In this paper, we propose a novel student-teacher paradigm where the teacher is trained in the standard way (reconstruction) before guiding the student to focus on the initial task (changing the cloth). The student additionally learns from an adversarial loss, which pushes it to follow the distribution of the real images. Consequently, the student exploits information that is masked to the teacher. A student trained without the adversarial loss would not use this information. Also, getting rid of both human parser and pose estimator at inference time allows obtaining a real-time virtual try-on.",

		"abstract": "Multi-task networks are commonly utilized to alleviate the need for a large number of highly specialized single-task networks. However, two common challenges in developing multi-task models are often overlooked in literature. First, enabling the model to be inherently incremental, continuously incorporating information from new tasks without forgetting the previously learned ones (incremental learning). Second, eliminating adverse interactions amongst tasks, which has been shown to significantly degrade the single-task performance in a multi-task setup (task interference). In this paper, we show that both can be achieved simply by reparameterizing the convolutions of standard neural network architectures into a non-trainable shared part (filter bank) and task-specific parts (modulators), where each modulator has a fraction of the filter bank parameters. Thus, our reparameterization enables the model to learn new tasks without adversely affecting the performance of existing ones. The results of our ablation study attest the efficacy of the proposed reparameterization. Moreover, our method achieves state-of-the-art on two challenging multi-task learning benchmarks, PASCAL-Context and NYUD, and also demonstrates superior incremental learning capability as compared to its close competitors.

		"title": "Learning Predictive Models from Observation and Interaction",
		"abstract": "Learning predictive models from interaction with the world allows an agent, such as a robot, to learn about how the world works, and then use this learned model to plan coordinated sequences of actions to bring about desired outcomes. However, learning a model that captures the dynamics of complex skills represents a major challenge: if the agent needs a good model to perform these skills, it might never be able to collect the experience on its own that is required to learn these delicate and complex behaviors. Instead, we can imagine augmenting the training set with observational data of other agents, such as humans. Such data is likely more plentiful, but cannot always be combined with data from the original agent. For example, videos of humans might show a robot how to use a tool, but (i) are not annotated with suitable robot actions, and (ii) contain a systematic distributional shift due to the embodiment differences between humans and robots. We address the first challenge by formulating the corresponding graphical model and treating the action as an observed variable for the interaction data and an unobserved variable for the observation data, and the second challenge by using a domain-dependent prior. In addition to interaction data, our method is able to leverage videos of passive observations in a driving dataset and a dataset of robotic manipulation videos to improve video prediction performance. We also demonstrate that, in a real-world tabletop robotic manipulation setting, we are able to significantly improve control performance by learning a model from both robot data and observations of humans.",

Combining the accuracy and refinement capabilities of iterative gradient-based optimization techniques with the robustness of deep neural networks, we propose a gradient descent algorithm that leverages a neural network to predict the parameter update rule for each iteration. This per-parameter and state-aware update guides the optimizer towards a good solution in very few steps, converging in typically few steps. During training our approach only requires MoCap data of human poses, parametrized via SMPL. From this data the network learns a subspace of valid poses and shapes in which optimization is performed much more efficiently. The approach does not require any hard to acquire image-to-3D correspondences. At test time we only optimize the 2D joint re-projection error without the need for any further priors or regularization terms. We show empirically that this algorithm is fast (avg. 120ms convergence), robust to initialization and dataset, and achieves state-of-the-art results on public evaluation datasets including the challenging 3DPW in-the-wild benchmark (improvement over SMPLify ($45\\%$) and also approaches using image-to-3D correspondences).",

L-VAEGAN can allow to automatically embed the information associated with different domains into several clusters in the latent space, while also capturing semantically meaningful shared latent variables, across different data domains.

By building a dense 3D map from stitched point clouds, frames within a video are geometrically correlated via this common 3D map. In order to fill a target inpainting area in a frame, it is straightforward to transform pixels from other frames into the current one with correct occlusion. Furthermore, we are able to fuse multiple videos through 3D point cloud registration, making it possible to inpaint a target video with multiple source videos. The motivation is to solve the long-time occlusion problem where an occluded area has never been visible in the entire video. This happens quite often for street view videos when there is a vehicle in the front. In this case, we can capture the scene a second time when the desired area becomes visible and do video fusion inpainting. To our knowledge, we are the first to fuse multiple videos for video inpainting. In order to evaluate our method, we collected 5 hour synchronized lidar and camera data from autonomous driving cars in the urban roads. To address long-time occlusion problems, we collect data for the same road in different days and times.

However, autoregressive models have several limitations such as exposure bias and their training objective does not guarantee visual fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose to use Reinforced Adversarial Learning (RAL) based on policy gradient optimization for autoregressive models. By applying RAL, we enable a similar process for training and testing to address the exposure bias issue. In addition, visual fidelity has been further optimized with adversarial loss inspired by their strong counterparts: GANs. Due to the slow sampling speed of autoregressive models, we propose to use partial generation for faster training. RAL also empowers the collaboration between different modules of the VQ-VAE framework. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is first to enable adversarial learning in autoregressive models for image generation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show improvements over the MLE trained models. The proposed method improves both negative log-likelihood (NLL) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which indicates improvements in terms of visual quality and diversity.

		"abstract": "Accurate 3D object detection in LiDAR based point clouds suffers from the challenges of data sparsity and irregularities. Existing methods strive to organize the points regularly, e.g. voxelize, pass them through a designed 2D/3D neural network, and then define object-level anchors that predict offsets of 3D bounding boxes using collective evidences from all the points on the objects of interest. Contrary to the state-of-the-art anchor-based methods, based on the very nature of data sparsity, we observe that even points on an individual object part are informative about semantic information of the object. We thus argue in this paper for an approach opposite to existing methods using object-level anchors. Inspired by compositional models, which represent an object as parts and their spatial relations, we propose to represent an object as composition of its interior non-empty voxels, termed hotspots, and the spatial relations of hotspots. This gives rise to the representation of Object as Hotspots (OHS). Based on OHS, we further propose an anchor-free detection head with a novel ground truth assignment strategy that deals with inter-object point-sparsity imbalance to prevent the network from biasing towards objects with more points. Experimental results show that our proposed method works remarkably well on objects with a small number of points. Notably, our approach ranked 1st on KITTI 3D Detection Benchmark for cyclist and pedestrian detection, and achieved state-of-the-art performance on NuScenes 3D Detection Benchmark.",

Imaging dynamic scenes in low-light environments is even more difficult because as the scene moves, pixels in adjacent frames need to be aligned before they can be denoised. Conventional CMOS image sensors (CIS) are at a particular disadvantage in dynamic low-light settings because the exposure cannot be too short lest the read noise overwhelms the signal. We propose a solution using Quanta Image Sensors (QIS) and present a new image reconstruction algorithm. QIS are single-photon image sensors with photon counting capabilities. Studies over the past decade have confirmed the effectiveness of QIS for low-light imaging but reconstruction algorithms for dynamic scenes in low light remain an open problem. We fill the gap by proposing a student-teacher training protocol that transfers knowledge from a motion teacher and a denoising teacher to a student network. We show that dynamic scenes can be reconstructed from a burst of frames at a photon level of 1 photon per pixel per frame. Experimental results confirm the advantages of the proposed method compared to existing methods.",

According to our method, the teacher's feature maps are first quantized to represent the main visual concepts (i.e., visual words) encompassed in these maps and then the student is asked to predict those visual word representations.

		"title": "EGDCL: An Adaptive Curriculum Learning Framework for Unbiased Glaucoma Diagnosis",
		"abstract": "Today's computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) model is still far from the clinical practice of glaucoma detection, mainly due to the training bias originating from 1) the normal-abnormal class imbalance and 2) the rare but significant hard samples in fundus images. However, debiasing in CAD is not trivial because existing methods cannot cure the two types of bias to categorize fundus images. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum learning paradigm (EGDCL) to train an unbiased glaucoma diagnosis model with the adaptive dual-curriculum. Innovatively, the dual-curriculum is designed with the guidance of evidence maps to build a training criterion, which gradually cures the bias in training data. In particular, the dual-curriculum emphasizes unbiased training contributions of data from easy to hard, normal to abnormal, and the dual-curriculum is optimized jointly with model parameters to obtain the optimal solution. In comparison to baselines, EGDCL significantly improves the convergence speed of the training process and obtains the top performance in the test procedure. Experimental results on challenging glaucoma datasets show that our EGDCL delivers unbiased diagnosis (0.9721 of Sensitivity, 0.9707 of Specificity, 0.993 of AUC, 0.966 of F2-score) and outperform the other methods. It endows our EGDCL a great advantage to handle the unbiased CAD in clinical application.",

However, the information of individually zeroed entries could still present in other correlated entries by propagating (1) spatially between entries of different node feature vectors and (2) depth-wisely between different entries of each node feature vector, which essentially weakens the effectiveness of dropout. This is mainly because in a GCN, neighboring node feature vectors after linear transformations are aggregated to produce new node feature vectors in the subsequent layer. To effectively regularize GCNs, we devise DropCluster which first randomly zeros some seed entries and then zeros entries that are spatially or depth-wisely correlated to those seed entries. In this way, the information of the seed entries is thoroughly removed and cannot flow to subsequent layers via the correlated entries. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed DropCluster by comprehensively comparing it with dropout and its representative variants, such as SpatialDropout, Gaussian dropout and DropEdge, on skeleton-based action recognition.",

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework that learns to adapt highlight detection to a user by exploiting the user's history in the form of highlights that the user has previously created. Our framework consists of two sub-networks: a fully temporal convolutional highlight detection network $H$ that predicts highlight for an input video and a history encoder network $M$ for user history. We introduce a newly designed temporal-adaptive instance normalization (T-AIN) layer to $H$ where the two sub-networks interact with each other. T-AIN has affine parameters that are predicted from $M$ based on the user history and is responsible for the user-adaptive signal to $H$. Extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset show that our framework can make more accurate and user-specific highlight predictions.",

In this work, we present the first attempt to automate the design of data augmentation policies for 3D object detection. We introduce the Progressive Population Based Augmentation (PPBA) algorithm, which learns to optimize augmentation strategies by narrowing down the search space and adopting the best parameters discovered in previous iterations. On the KITTI 3D detection test set, PPBA improves the StarNet detector by substantial margins on the moderate difficulty category of cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, outperforming all current state-of-the-art single-stage detection models. Additional experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset indicate that PPBA continues to effectively improve the StarNet and PointPillars detectors on a 20x larger dataset compared to KITTI. The magnitude of the improvements may be comparable to advances in 3D perception architectures and the gains come without an incurred cost at inference time. In subsequent experiments, we find that PPBA may be up to 10x more data efficient than baseline 3D detection models without augmentation, highlighting that 3D detection models may achieve competitive accuracy with far fewer labeled examples.",

Specifically, the similarity is defined by mean-squared errors over HardNet features computed from probabilistic keypoint maps of the compared images. Our differential visual shape similarity metric can be easily plugged into various 3D reconstruction networks, replacing their distortion-based losses, such as Chamfer or Earth Mover distances, so as to optimize the network weights to produce reconstructions with better structural fidelity and visual quality.

There are a variety of DA scenarios subject to label sets and domain configurations, including closed-set and partial-set DA, as well as multi-source and multi-target DA. It is notable that existing DA methods are generally designed only for a specific scenario, and may underperform for scenarios they are not tailored to. In this paper, we propose Versatile Domain Adaptation (VDA), where one method can handle several different scenarios at the same time. Towards handling it, a more general inductive bias other than the domain alignment should be explored. We delve into a missing piece of existing methods: class confusion, the tendency that a classifier confuses the predictions between the correct and ambiguous classes for target examples, which exists in different scenarios. We unveil that reducing such pair-wise class confusion brings about significant transfer gains. Based on this, we propose a general loss function: Minimum Class Confusion (MCC). It can be characterized by (1) a non-adversarial DA method without explicitly deploying domain alignment, enjoying fast convergence speed; (2) a versatile approach that can handle the four existing scenarios: Closed-Set, Partial-Set, Multi-Source, and Multi-Target DA, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in these scenarios, especially on the largest and hardest dataset to date (7.3% on DomainNet). Strong performance in the two scenarios proposed in this paper: Multi-Source Partial and Multi-Target Partial DA, further proves its versatility.

In addition, we propose a new Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for table recognition, which more appropriately captures multi-hop cell misalignment and OCR errors than the pre-established metric. The experiments demonstrate that the EDD model can accurately recognize complex tables solely relying on the image representation, outperforming the state-of-the-art by 9.7% absolute TEDS score.",

Existing action prediction approaches learn to enhance the representation power of the partial observation. However, for group activity prediction, the relation evolution of people’s activity and their positions over time is an important cue for predicting group activity. To this end, we propose a sequential relational anticipation model (SRAM) that summarizes the relational dynamics in the partial observation and progressively anticipates the group representations with rich discriminative information. Our model explicitly anticipates both activity features and positions by two graph auto-encoders, aiming to learn a discriminative group representation for group activity prediction. Experimental results on two popularly used datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art activity prediction methods.",

		"abstract": "Despite their strong modeling capacities, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often scale-sensitive. For enhancing the robustness of CNNs to scale variance, multi-scale feature fusion from different layers or filters attracts great attention among existing solutions, while the more granular kernel space is overlooked. We bridge this regret by exploiting multi-scale features in a finer granularity. The proposed convolution operation, named Poly-Scale Convolution (PSConv), mixes up a spectrum of dilation rates and tactfully allocates them in the individual convolutional kernels of each filter regarding a single convolutional layer. Specifically, dilation rates vary cyclically along the axes of input and output channels of the filters, aggregating features over a wide range of scales in a neat style. PSConv could be a drop-in replacement of the vanilla convolution in many prevailing CNN backbones, allowing better representation learning without introducing additional parameters and computational complexities. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS COCO benchmarks validate the superior performance of PSConv. Code and models are available at https://github.com/d-li14/PSConv",

The region-wise features, in spite of aligning well with the proposal locations, may still lack the crucial context information which is necessary for filtering out noisy background detections, as well as recognizing objects possessing no distinctive appearances. To address this issue, we present a simple but effective Hierarchical Context Embedding (HCE) framework, which can be applied as a plug-and-play component, to facilitate the classification ability of a series of region-based detectors by mining contextual cues. Specifically, to advance the recognition of context-dependent object categories, we propose an image-level categorical embedding module which leverages the holistic image-level context to learn object-level concepts. Then, novel RoI features are generated by exploiting hierarchically embedded context information beneath both whole images and interested regions, which are also complementary to conventional RoI features. Moreover, to make full use of our hierarchical contextual RoI features, we propose the early-and-late fusion strategies (\\ie, feature fusion and confidence fusion), which can be combined to boost the classification accuracy of region-based detectors. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our HCE framework is flexible and generalizable, leading to significant and consistent improvements upon various region-based detectors, including FPN, Cascade R-CNN and Mask R-CNN.",

In this work, we approach this problem by addressing two issues that have been under-researched in the open literature: sampling strategy (data term) and graph construction (prior term). First, instead of the popular random sampling strategy, we suggest that Poisson disk sampling is a much more effective solution to create sparse depth map from a dense version. We experimentally compare a class of quasi-random sampling strategies and demonstrate that an optimized sampling strategy can significantly improve the performance of depth completion for the same number of sparse samples. Second, instead of the traditional square kernel, we suggest that dynamic construction of local neighborhood is a better choice for interpolating the missing values. More specifically, we proposed an end-to-end network with a graph convolution module. Since the neighborhood relationship of 3D points is more effectively exploited by our novel graph convolution module, our approach has achieved not only state-of-the-art results for depth completion of indoor scenes but also better generalization ability than other competing methods.",

Besides designing the depth, type of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearities, the topological connectivity of neural networks is also important. Previous principles of rule-based modular design simplify the difficulty of building an effective architecture, but constrain the possible topologies in limited spaces. In this paper, we attempt to optimize the connectivity in neural networks. We propose a topological perspective to represent a network into a complete graph for analysis, where nodes carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and edges determine the flow of information. By assigning learnable parameters to the edges which reflect the magnitude of connections, the learning process can be performed in a differentiable manner. We further attach auxiliary sparsity constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned topology focus on critical connections. This learning process is compatible with existing networks and owns adaptability to larger search spaces and different tasks. Quantitative results of experiments reflect the learned connectivity is superior to traditional rule-based ones, such as random, residual and complete. In addition, it obtains significant improvements in image classification and object detection without introducing excessive computation burden.",

We find the underlying reason is that the regression network in anchor-based methods is only trained on the positive anchor boxes ($IoU \\geq 0.6$). This mechanism makes it difficult to refine the anchors whose overlap with the target objects are small. In this paper, we propose a novel object-aware anchor-free network to address this issue. First, instead of refining the reference anchor boxes, we directly predict the position and scale of target objects in an anchor-free fashion. Since each pixel in the groundtruth box is well trained, the tracker is capable of rectifying the weak predictions of target objects during inference. Second, we introduce a feature alignment module to learn an object-aware feature which corresponds with the predicted bounding box. The object-aware feature can further contribute to the classification of target object and background. Moreover, we present a novel Siamese tracking framework based on the anchor-free model.

The sparse adversarial attack involves two challenges, i.e., where to perturb, and how to determine the perturbation magnitude. Many existing works determined the perturbed positions manually or heuristically, and then optimized the magnitude using a proper algorithm designed for the dense adversarial attack. In this work, we propose to factorize the perturbation at each pixel to the product of two variables, including the perturbation magnitude and one binary selection factor (i.e., 0 or 1). One pixel is perturbed if its selection factor is 1, otherwise not perturbed. Based on this factorization, we formulate the sparse attack problem as a mixed integer programming (MIP) to jointly optimize the binary selection factors and continuous perturbation magnitudes of all pixels, with a cardinality constraint on selection factors to explicitly control the degree of sparsity. Besides, the perturbation factorization provides the extra flexibility to incorporate other meaningful constraints on selection factors or magnitudes to achieve some desired performance, such as the group-wise sparsity or the enhanced visual imperceptibility. We develop an efficient algorithm by equivalently reformulating the MIP problem as a continuous optimization problem. Experiments on benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art sparse attack methods.",

By coupling such array with a video camera, we obtain spatio-temporal alignment of acoustic images and video frames. This constitutes a powerful source of self-supervision, which can be exploited in the learning pipeline we are proposing, without resorting to expensive data annotations. However, since 2D planar arrays are cumbersome and not as widespread as ordinary microphones, we propose that the richer information content of acoustic images can be distilled, through a self-supervised learning scheme, into more powerful audio and visual feature representations. The learnt feature representations can then be employed for downstream tasks such as classification and cross-modal retrieval, without the need of a microphone array. To prove that, we introduce a novel multimodal dataset consisting in RGB videos, raw audio signals and acoustic images, aligned in space and synchronized in time.

		"abstract": "RGB and thermal source data suffer from both shared and specific challenges, and how to explore and exploit them plays a critical role to represent the target appearance in RGBT tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel challenge-aware neural network to handle the modality-shared challenges (e.g., fast motion, scale variation and occlusion) and the modality-specific ones (e.g., illumination variation and thermal crossover) for RGBT tracking. In particular, we design several parameter-shared branches in each layer to model the target appearance under the modality-shared challenges, and several parameter-independent branches under the modality-specific ones. Based on the observation that the modality-specific cues of different modalities usually contains the complementary advantages, we propose a guidance module to transfer discriminative features from one modality to another one, which could enhance the discriminative ability of some weak modality. Moreover, all branches are aggregated together in an adaptive manner and parallel embedded in the backbone network to efficiently form more discriminative target representations. These challenge-aware branches are able to model the target appearance under certain challenges so that the target representations can be learnt by a few parameters even in the situation of insufficient training data. From the experimental results we will show that our method operates at a real-time speed while performing well against the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets.",

However these approaches are very expensive as they treat the entire data generation, model training, and validation pipeline as a black-box and require multiple costly objective evaluations at each iteration. We propose an efficient alternative for optimal synthetic data generation, based on a novel differentiable approximation of the objective. This allows us to optimize the simulator, which may be non-differentiable, requiring only one objective evaluation at each iteration with a little overhead. We demonstrate on a state-of-the-art photorealistic renderer that the proposed method finds the optimal data distribution faster (up to 50 times), with significantly reduced training data generation and better accuracy than previous methods.",

Drawing lessons from lattice filter bank, we design the lattice block (LB) in which two butterfly structures are applied to combine two RBs. LB has the potential of various linear combinations of two RBs. Each case of LB depends on the combination coefficients which are determined by the attention mechanism. LB favors the lightweight SR model with the reduction of about half amount of the parameters while keeping the similar SR performance.

		"abstract": "Self-supervised learning approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) of semantic segmentation models suffer from challenges of predicting and selecting reasonable good quality pseudo labels.In this paper, we propose a novel approach of exploiting scale-invariance property of the semantic segmentation model for self-supervised domain adaptation. Our algorithm is based on a reasonable assumption that, in general, regardless of the size of the object and stuff (given context) the semantic labeling should be unchanged. We show that this constraint is violated over the images of the target domain, and hence could be used to transfer labels in-between differently scaled patches. Specifically, we show that semantic segmentation model produces output with high entropy when presented with scaled-up patches of target domain, in comparison to when presented original size images. These scale-invariant examples are extracted from the most confident images of the target domain. Dynamic class specific entropy thresholding mechanism is presented to filter out unreliable pseudo-labels. Furthermore, we also incorporate the focal loss to tackle the problem of class imbalance in self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments have been performed, and results indicate that exploiting the scale-invariant labeling, we outperform existing self-supervised based state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

		"abstract": "Vision-language navigation (VLN) is the task of entailing an agent to carry out navigational instructions inside photo-realistic environments. One of the key challenges in VLN is how to conduct a robust navigation by mitigating the uncertainty caused by ambiguous instructions and insufficient observation of the environment. Agents trained by current approaches typically suffer from this and would consequently struggle to avoid random and inefficient actions at every step. In contrast, when humans face such a challenge, they can still maintain robust navigation by actively exploring the surroundings to gather more information and thus make more confident navigation decisions. This work draws inspiration from human navigation behavior and endows an agent with an active information gathering ability for a more intelligent vision-language navigation policy. To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end framework for learning an exploration policy that decides i) when and where to explore, ii) what information is worth gathering during exploration, and extbf{iii)} how to adjust the navigation decision after the exploration. The experimental results show promising exploration strategies emerged from training, which leads to significant boost in navigation performance.

		"title": "Why Are Deep Representations Good Perceptual Quality Features",
		"abstract": "Recently, intermediate feature maps of pre-trained convolutional neural networks have shown significant perceptual quality improvements, when they are used in the loss function for training new networks. It is believed that these features are better at encoding the perceptual quality and provide more efficient representations of input images compared to other perceptual metrics such as SSIM and PSNR. However, there have been no systematic studies to determine the underlying reason. Due to the lack of such an analysis, it is not possible to evaluate the performance of a particular set of features or to improve the perceptual quality even more by carefully selecting a subset of features from a pre-trained CNN. This work shows that the capabilities of pre-trained deep CNN features in optimizing the perceptual quality are correlated with their success in capturing basic human visual perception characteristics. In particular, we focus our analysis on fundamental aspects of human perception, such as the contrast sensitivity and orientation selectivity. We introduce two new formulations to measure the frequency and orientation selectivity of the features learned by convolutional layers for evaluating deep features learned by widely-used deep CNNs such as VGG-16. We demonstrate that the pre-trained CNN features which receive higher scores are better at predicting human quality judgment. Furthermore, we show the possibility of using our method to select deep features to form a new loss function, which improves the image reconstruction quality for the well-known single-image super-resolution problem.",

We first introduce a feedback loop, from a semantic embedding decoder, that iteratively refines the generated features during both the training and feature synthesis stages. The synthesized features together with their corresponding latent embeddings from the decoder are then transformed into discriminative features and utilized during classification to reduce ambiguities among categories.

Therefore, we argue that by providing human labeled correspondences between different objects from the same category instead of explicit semantic labels, one can recover rich semantic information of an object. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset named CorresPondenceNet. Based on this dataset, we are able to learn dense semantic embeddings with a novel geodesic consistency loss.

Since object arrangement and scene layout are intrinsically coupled, we show that treating the problem jointly significantly helps to produce globally-consistent representations of a scene. Object CAD models are aligned to the scene by establishing dense correspondences between geometry, and we introduce a hierarchical layout prediction approach to estimate layout planes from corners and edges of the scene. To this end, we propose a message-passing graph neural network to model the inter-relationships between objects and layout, guiding generation of a globally object alignment in a scene.

Since the pixel-level annotation is not available in the training process, we rely on region mining models to estimate the pseudo-masks from the image-level labels. Thus, in order to improve the final segmentation results, we aim to train a region-mining model which could accurately and completely highlight the target object regions for generating high-quality pseudo-masks. However, the region mining models are likely to only highlight the most discriminative regions instead of the entire objects. In this paper, we aim to tackle this problem from a novel perspective of optimization process. We propose a Splitting vs. Merging optimization strategy, which is mainly composed of the Discrepancy loss and the Intersection loss. The proposed Discrepancy loss aims at mining out regions of diﬀerent spatial patterns instead of only the most discriminative region, which leads to the splitting eﬀect. The Intersection loss aims at mining the common regions of the diﬀerent maps, which leads to the merging eﬀect. Our Splitting vs. Merging strategy helps to expand the output heatmap of the region mining model to the object scale. Finally, by training the segmentation model with the masks generated by our Splitting vs Merging strategy, we achieve the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation results on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark.",

		"title": "Temporal Keypoint Matching and Refinement Network for Pose Estimation and Tracking",
		"abstract": "Multi-person pose estimation and tracking in realistic videos is very challenging due to factors such as occlusions, fast motion and pose variations. Top-down approaches are commonly used for this task, which involves three stages: person detection, single-person pose estimation, and pose association across time. Recently, significant progress has been made in person detection and single-person pose estimation. In this paper, we mainly focus on improving pose association and estimation in a video to build a strong pose estimator and tracker. To this end, we propose a novel temporal keypoint matching and refinement network. Specifically, we propose two network modules, temporal keypoint matching and temporal keypoint refinement, which are incorporated into a single-person pose estimatin network. The temporal keypoint matching module learns a simialrity metric for matching keypoints across frames. Pose matching is performed by aggregating keypoint similarities between poses in adjacent frames. The temporal keypoint refinement module serves to correct individual poses by utilizing their associated poses in neighboring frames as temporal context. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed network on two benchmark datasets: PoseTrack 2017 and PoseTrack 2018. Exprimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.",

The approach uses a raw point cloud as the geometric representation of a scene, and augments each point with a learnable neural descriptor that encodes local geometry and appearance. A deep rendering network is learned in parallel with the descriptors, so that new views of the scene can be obtained by passing the rasterizations of a point cloud from new viewpoints through this network. The input rasterizations use the learned descriptors as point pseudo-colors. We show that the proposed approach can be used for modeling complex scenes and obtaining their photorealistic views, while avoiding explicit surface estimation and meshing. In particular, compelling results are obtained for scenes scanned using hand-held commodity RGB-D sensors as well as standard RGB cameras even in the presence of objects that are challenging for standard mesh-based modeling.",

MoVi-3D builds upon a novel approach which leverages geometrical information to generate, both at training and test time, virtual views where the object appearance is normalized with respect to distance. These virtually generated views facilitate the detection task as they significantly reduce the visual appearance variability associated to objects placed at different distances from the camera. As a consequence, the deep model is relieved from learning depth-specific representations and its complexity can be significantly reduced.

Unlike conventional methods that exploit predefined anchors, the confidence-aware calibration offers adaptive anchor initialization for detection with occlusions, and helps reduce the gap between visible-part and full-body detection.

		"abstract": "Articulations, Shapes and Objects for 3D Hand Pose Estimation under Hand-Object Interaction\",\"We study how well different types of approaches generalise in the task of 3D hand pose estimation under single hand scenarios and hand-object interaction. We show that the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods can drop, and that they fail mostly on poses absent from the training set. Unfortunately, since the space of hand poses is highly dimensional, it is inherently not feasible to cover the whole space densely, despite recent efforts in collecting large-scale training datasets. This sampling problem is even more severe when hands are interacting with objects and/or inputs are RGB rather than depth images, as RGB images also vary with lighting conditions and colors. To address these issues, we designed a public challenge (HANDS'19) to evaluate the abilities of current 3D hand pose estimators~(HPEs) to interpolate and extrapolate the poses of a training set. More exactly, HANDS'19 is designed (a) to evaluate the influence of both depth and color modalities on 3D hand pose estimation, under the presence or absence of objects; (b) to assess the generalisation abilities w.r.t. four main axes: shapes, articulations, viewpoints, and objects; (c) to explore the use of a synthetic hand models to fill the gaps of current datasets. Through the challenge, the overall accuracy has dramatically improved over the baseline, especially on extrapolation tasks, from 27mm to 13mm mean joint error. Our analyses highlight the impacts of: ensemble approaches, the use of a parametric 3D hand model (MANO), and different HPE methods/backbones.",

		"title": "A Closer Look at Local Aggregation Operators in Point Cloud Analysis",
		"abstract": "Recent advances of network architecture for point cloud processing are mainly driven by new designs of local aggregation operators. However, the impact of these operators to network performance is not carefully investigated due to different overall network architecture and implementation details in each solution. Meanwhile, most of operators are only applied in shallow architectures. In this paper, we revisit the representative local aggregation operators and study their performance using the same deep residual architecture. Our investigation reveals that depsite the different designs of these operators, all of these operators make surprisingly similar contributions to the network performance under the same network input and feature numbers and result in the state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks. This finding stimulate us to rethink the necessity of sophisticated design of local aggregation operator for point cloud processing. To this end, we propose a simple local aggregation operator without learnable weights, named Position Pooling (PosPool), which performs similarly or slightly better than existing sophisticated operators. In particular, a simple deep residual network with PosPool layers exhibits outstanding performance on all benchmarks, which outperforms the previous state-of-the methods on the challenging PartNet datasets by a large margin (6.4 mIoU).",

		"abstract": "Across photography, marketing, and website design, being able to direct the viewer's attention is a powerful tool. Motivated by professional workflows, we introduce an automatic method to make an image region more attention-capturing via subtle image edits that maintain realism and fidelity to the original. From an input image and a user-provided mask, our GazeShiftNet model predicts a distinct set of global parametric transformations to be applied to the foreground and background image regions separately. We present the results of quantitative and qualitative experiments that demonstrate improvements over prior state-of-the-art. In contrast to existing attention shifting algorithms, our global parametric approach better preserves image semantics and avoids typical generative artifacts. Our edits enable inference at interactive rates on any image size, and easily generalize to videos. Extensions of our model allow for multi-style edits and the ability to both increase and attenuate attention in an image region. Furthermore, users can customize the edited images by dialing the edits up or down via interpolations in parameter space. This paper presents a practical tool that can simplify future image editing pipelines.",

This is a construction that strives to define the data manifold. A major obstacle to VAEs and GANs, however, is choosing a suitable prior that matches the data topology. Well-known consequences of poorly picked priors are posterior and mode collapse. To our knowledge, no existing method sidesteps this user choice. Conversely, extit{diffusion maps} automatically infer the data topology and enjoy a rigorous connection to manifold learning, but do not scale easily or provide the inverse homeomorphism (i.e. decoder/generator). We propose a method that combines these approaches into a generative model that inherits the asymptotic guarantees of extit{diffusion maps} while preserving the scalability of deep models.

		"title": "Adaptive Variance Based Label Distribution Learning For Facial Age Estimation",
		"abstract": "Estimating age from a single facial image is a classic and challenging topic in computer vision. One of its most intractable issues is label ambiguity, i.e., face images from adjacent age of the same person are often indistinguishable. Some existing methods adopt distribution learning to tackle this issue by exploiting the semantic correlation between age labels. Actually, most of them set a fixed value to the variance of Gaussian label distribution for all the images. However, the variance is closely related to the correlation between adjacent ages and should vary across ages and identities. To model a sample-specific variance, in this paper, we propose an adaptive variance based distribution learning (AVDL) method for facial age estimation. AVDL introduces the data-driven optimization framework, meta-learning, to achieve this. Specifically, AVDL performs a meta gradient descent step on the variable (i.e. variance) to minimize the loss on a clean unbiased validation set. By adaptively learning proper variance for each sample, our method can approximate the true age probability distribution more effectively. Extensive experiments on FG-NET and MORPH II datasets show the superiority of our proposed approach to the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Most existing methods are optimized for deterministic generation of SR images under pre-defined objectives such as pixel-level reconstruction and thus limited to the one-to-one correspondence between LR and SR images against the nature. In this paper, we propose VarSR, Variational Super Resolution Network, that matches latent distributions of LR and HR images to recover the missing details. Specifically, we draw samples from the learned common latent distribution of LR and HR to generate diverse SR images as the many-to-one relationship.

In this work, we present a novel segmentation strategy, co-heterogenous andadaptive segmentation (CHASe), which only requires a small labeled cohort of single phase data to adapt to any unlabeled cohort of heterogenous multi-phase data with possibly new clinical scenarios and pathologies. To do this, we develop a versatile framework that fuses appearance-based semi-supervision, mask-based adversarial domain adaptation, and pseudo-labeling. We also introduce co-heterogeneous training, which is a novel integration of co-training and hetero-modality learning. We evaluate CHASe using a clinically comprehensive and challenging dataset of multi-phase computed tomography (CT) imaging studies (1147 patients and 4577 3D volumes), with a test set of 100 patients. Compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines, CHASe can further improve pathological liver mask Dice-Sørensen coefficients by ranges of 4.2% to 9.4%, depending on the phase combinations, e.g., from 84.6% to 94.0% on non-contrast CTs.",

The key idea is that we first train a slimmed model with a random projected softmax classifier and then we recover it to the original version. We also show a theoretical guarantee that this recovered classifier can approximate the original classifier with a small error.

(2) We exploit the inherent hierarchical structure of proposals as an effective regularizer for the approach to object discovery of [34], boosting its performance to significantly improve over the state of the art on several standard benchmarks. (3) We adopt a two-stage strategy to select promising proposals using small random sets of images before using the whole image collection to discover the objects it depicts, allowing us to tackle, for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), the discovery of multiple objects in each one of the pictures making up datasets with up to 20,000 images, an over five-fold increase compared to existing methods, and a first step toward true large-scale unsupervised image interpretation.",

		"abstract": "We propose a new deep neural network which takes a colored 3D point cloud of a scene, and directly synthesizes a photo-realistic image from an arbitrary viewpoint. Key contributions of this work include a deep point feature extraction module, an image synthesis module, and an image refinement module. Our PointEncoder network extracts discriminative features from the point cloud that contain both local and global contextual information about the scene. Next, the multi-level point features are aggregated to form multi-layer feature maps. These are fed into our ImageDecoder network in order to generate a synthetic RGB image. Finally, the coarse output of the ImageDecoder network is refined using our RefineNet module, supplying more fine details and suppressing unwanted visual artifacts. To generate virtual camera viewpoints in the scene, we rotate and translate the 3D point cloud in order to synthesize new images from novel perspectives. We conduct numerous experiments on public datasets to validate our method, with respect to the quality of the synthesized views, and outperform state-of-the-art significantly.",

		"title": "Consensus-Aware Visual-Semantic Embedding for Image-Text Matching",
		"abstract": "Image-text matching plays a central role in bridging vision and language. Most existing approaches only rely on the image-text instance pair to learn their representations, thereby exploiting their matching relationships and making the corresponding alignments. Such approaches only exploit the superficial associations contained in the instance pairwise data, with no consideration of any external commonsense knowledge, which may hinder their capabilities to reason the higher-level relationships between image and text. In this paper, we propose a Consensus-aware Visual-Semantic Embedding (CVSE) model to incorporate the consensus information, namely the commonsense knowledge shared between both modalities, into image-text matching. Specifically, the consensus information is exploited by computing the statistical co-occurrence correlations between the semantic concepts from the image captioning corpus and deploying the constructed concept correlation graph to yield the consensus-aware concept (CAC) representations. Afterwards, CVSE learns the associations and alignments between image and text based on the exploited consensus as well as the instance-level representations for both modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets verify that the exploited consensus makes significant contributions to constructing more meaningful visual-semantic embeddings, with the superior performances over the state-of-the-art approaches on the bidirectional image and text retrieval task.

		"abstract": "Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors have been increasingly used on mobile devices for depth sensing. However, the existence of noise, such as Multi-Path Interference (MPI) and shot noise, degrades the ToF imaging quality. Previous CNN-based methods remove ToF depth noise without considering the spatial hierarchical structure of the scene, which leads to failures in obtaining high quality depth images from a complex scene. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Hierarchy Aware Residual Pyramid Network, called SHARP-Net, to remove the depth noise by fully exploiting the geometry information of the scene on different scales. SHARP-Net first introduces a Residual Regression Module, which utilizes the depth images and amplitude images as the input, to calculate the depth residual progressively. Then, a Residual Fusion Module, summing over depth residuals from all scales, is imported to fuse multi-scale geometry information. Finally, shot noise is further eliminated by a Kernel Prediction Network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ToF depth denoising methods on both synthetic and realistic datasets.

The key idea in Sat2Graph is a novel encoding scheme, graph-tensor encoding (GTE), which encodes the road graph into a tensor representation. GTE makes it possible to train a simple, non-recurrent, supervised model to predict a rich set of features that capture the graph structure directly from an image. We evaluate Sat2Graph using two large datasets. We find that Sat2Graph surpasses prior methods on two widely used metrics, TOPO and APLS. Furthermore, whereas prior work only infers planar road graphs, our approach is capable of inferring stacked roads (e.g., overpasses), and does so robustly.",

		"abstract": "While deep face recognition has benefited significantly from large-scale labeled data, current research is focused on leveraging unlabeled data to further boost performance, reducing the cost of human annotation. Prior work has mostly been in controlled settings, where the labeled and unlabeled data sets have no overlapping identities by construction. This is not realistic in large-scale face recognition, where one must contend with such overlaps, the frequency of which increases with the volume of data. Ignoring identity overlap leads to significant labeling noise, as data from the same identity is split into multiple clusters. To address this, we propose a novel identity separation method based on extreme value theory. It is formulated as an out-of-distribution detection algorithm, and greatly reduces the problems caused by overlapping-identity label noise. Considering cluster assignments as pseudo-labels, we must also overcome the labeling noise from clustering errors. We propose a modulation of the cosine loss, where the modulation weights correspond to an estimate of clustering uncertainty. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real settings demonstrate our method's consistent improvements over supervised baselines, e.g., 11.6% improvement on IJB-A verification.",

The task is to estimate the absolute orientations of several cameras given some of their noisy relative orientation measurements. The conventional methods for this task seek parameters of the absolute orientations that agree best with the observed noisy measurements according to a robust cost function. These robust cost functions are highly nonlinear and are designed based on certain assumptions about the noise and outlier distributions. In this work, we aim to build a neural network that learns the noise patterns from the data and predict/regress the model parameters from the noisy relative orientations. The proposed network is a combination of two networks: (1) a view-graph cleaning network, which detects outlier edges in the view-graph and rectifies noisy measurements; and (2) a fine-tuning network, which fine-tunes an initialization of absolute orientations bootstrapped from the cleaned graph, in a single step. The proposed combined network is very fast, moreover, being trained on a large number of synthetic graphs, it is more accurate than the conventional iterative optimization methods. Although the idea of replacing robust optimization methods by a graph-based network is demonstrated only for multiple rotation averaging, it could easily be extended to other graph-based geometric problems, for example, pose-graph optimization.",

Our method learns the co-occurrences, and appearance parameters such as shape and pose, for different objects categories through a grammar-based auto-encoder, resulting in a compact and accurate representation for scene layouts. In contrast to existing grammar-based methods with a user-specified grammar, we construct the grammar automatically by extracting a set of production rules on reasoning about object co-occurrences in training data. The extracted grammar is able to represent a scene by an augmented parse tree. The proposed auto-encoder encodes these parse trees to a latent code, and decodes the latent code to a parse tree, thereby ensuring the generated scene is always valid. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed auto-encoder learns not only to generate valid scenes (i.e. the arrangements and appearances of objects), but it also learns coherent latent representations where nearby latent samples decode to similar scene outputs. The obtained generative model is applicable to several computer vision tasks such as 3D pose and layout estimation from RGB-D data.",

To this end, we propose P$^2$Net. We first extract points with large local gradients and adopt patches centered at each point as its representation. Multiview consistency loss is then defined over patches. This operation significantly improves the robustness of the network training. Furthermore, because those textureless regions in indoor scenes (\u001bg, wall, floor, roof, \u001btc) usually correspond to planar regions, we propose to leverage superpixels as a plane prior.

The Transformer has recently been extended and applied to several bi-modal tasks, yielding promising results. For visual dialog, it becomes necessary to consider interactions between three or more inputs, i.e., an image, a question, and a dialog history, or even its individual dialog components. In this paper, we present a neural architecture named Light-weight Transformer for Many Inputs (LTMI) that can efficiently deal with all the interactions between multiple such inputs in visual dialog. It has a block structure similar to the Transformer and employs the same design of attention computation, whereas it has only a small number of parameters, yet has sufficient representational power for the purpose. Assuming a standard setting of visual dialog, a layer built upon the proposed attention block has less than one-tenth of parameters as compared with its counterpart, a natural Transformer extension.

		"abstract": "Conventional object detection models inevitably encounter a performance drop as the domain disparity exists. Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection is proposed recently to reduce the disparity between domains, where the source domain is label-rich while the target domain is label-agnostic. The existing models follow a parameter shared siamese structure for adversarial domain alignment, which, however, easily leads to the collapse and out-of-control risk of the source domain and brings negative impact to feature adaption. The main reason is that the labeling unfairness (asymmetry) between source and target makes the parameter sharing mechanism unable to adapt. Therefore, in order to avoid the source domain collapse risk caused by parameter sharing, we propose an asymmetric tri-way Faster-RCNN (ATF) for domain adaptive object detection. Our ATF model has two distinct merits: 1) A ancillary net supervised by source label is deployed to learn ancillary target features and simultaneously preserve the discrimination of source domain, which enhances the structural discrimination (object classification vs. bounding box regression) of domain alignment. 2) The asymmetric structure consisting of a chief net and an independent ancillary net essentially overcomes the parameter sharing aroused source risk collapse. The adaption safety of the proposed ATF detector is guaranteed.

		"abstract": "Recent research efforts enable study for natural language grounded navigation in photo-realistic environments, e.g., following natural language instructions or dialog. However, existing methods tend to overfit training data in seen environments and fail to generalize well in previously unseen environments. To close the gap between seen and unseen environments, we aim at learning a generalized navigation model from two novel perspectives:(1) we introduce a multitask navigation model that can be seamlessly trained on both Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) and Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) tasks, which benefits from richer natural language guidance and effectively transfers knowledge across tasks;(2) we propose to learn environment-agnostic representations for the navigation policy that are invariant among the environments seen during training, thus generalizing better on unseen environments. Extensive experiments show that environment-agnostic multitask learning significantly reduces the performance gap between seen and unseen environments, and the navigation agent trained so outperforms baselines on unseen environments by 16\\% (relative measure on success rate) on VLN and 120\\% (goal progress) on NDH.

		"abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) has been widely investigated in both computer vision and natural language processing. However, studies on the imperfect data especially with missing values are still far from success and challenging, even though such an issue is ubiquitous in the real world. Although previous works show the promising performance by exploiting the low-rank structures of the fused features, only the first-order statistics of the temporal dynamics are concerned. To this end, we propose a novel network architecture termed Time Product Fusion Network (TPFN), which takes the high-order statistics over both modalities and temporal dynamics into account. We construct the fused features by the outer product along adjacent time-steps, such that richer modal and temporal interactions are utilized. In addition, we claim that the low-rank structures can be obtained by regularizing the Frobenius norm of latent factors instead of the fused features. Experiments on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets show that TPFN can compete with state-of-the art approaches in multimodal sentiment analysis in cases of both random and structured missing values.",

The local one-hot classification assigns images in a training batch with different person IDs, then adopts a Self-Adaptive Classification (SAC) model to classify them. The global multi-class classification is achieved by predicting labels on the entire unlabeled training set with the Memory-based Temporal-guided Cluster (MTC). MTC predicts multi-class labels by considering both visual similarity and temporal consistency to ensure the quality of label prediction. The two classification models are combined in a unified framework, which effectively leverages the unlabeled data for discriminative feature learning.

Nevertheless, how to efficiently model the spatial-temporal skeleton graph without introducing extra computation burden is a challenging problem for industrial deployment. In this paper, we rethink the spatial aggregation in existing GCN-based skeleton action recognition methods and discover that they are limited by coupling aggregation mechanism. Inspired by the decoupling aggregation mechanism in CNNs, we propose decoupling GCN to boost the graph modeling ability with no extra computation, no extra latency, no extra GPU memory cost, and less than 10% extra parameters. Another prevalent problem of GCNs is over-fitting. Although dropout is a widely used regularization technique, it is not effective for GCNs, due to the fact that activation units are correlated between neighbor nodes. We propose DropGraph to discard features in correlated nodes, which is particularly effective on GCNs. Moreover, we introduce an attention-guided drop mechanism to enhance the regularization effect.

Using a gating mechanism that discriminates the unseen samples from the seen samples can decompose the GZSL problem to a conventional Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) problem and a supervised classification problem. However, training the gate is usually challenging due to the lack of data in the unseen domain. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a boundary based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classifier which classifies the unseen and seen domains by only using seen samples for training. First, we learn a shared latent space on a unit hyper-sphere where the latent distributions of visual features and semantic attributes are aligned class-wisely. Then we find the boundary and the center of the manifold for each class. By leveraging the class centers and boundaries, the unseen samples can be separated from the seen samples. After that, we use two experts to classify the seen and unseen samples separately. We extensively validate our approach on five popular benchmark datasets including AWA1, AWA2, CUB, FLO and SUN.

		"abstract": "Adversarial domain adaptation has made tremendous success by learning domain-invariant feature representations. However, conventional adversarial training pushes two domains together and brings uncertainty to feature learning, which deteriorates the discriminability in the target domain. In this paper, we tackle this problem by designing a simple yet effective scheme, namely Asymmetric Adversarial Domain Adaptation (AADA). We notice that source features preserve great feature discriminability due to full supervision, and therefore a novel asymmetric training scheme is designed to keep the source features fixed and encourage the target features approaching to the source features, which best preserves the feature discriminability learned from source labeled data. This is achieved by an autoencoder-based domain discriminator that only embeds the source domain, while the feature extractor learns to deceive the autoencoder by embedding the target domain. Theoretical justifications corroborate that our method minimizes the domain discrepancy and spectral analysis is employed to quantize the improved feature discriminability. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate that our method outperforms existing adversarial domain adaptation methods significantly and demonstrates robustness with respect to hyper-parameter sensitivity.",

State-of-the-art methods show promising results by representing shapes using implicit functions in 3D that are learned using discriminative neural networks. However, learning implicit functions requires dense and irregular sampling in 3D space, which also makes the sampling methods affect the accuracy of shape reconstruction during test. To avoid dense and irregular sampling in 3D, we propose to represent shapes using 2D functions, where the output of the function at each 2D location is a sequence of line segments inside the shape. Our approach leverages the power of functional representations, but without the disadvantage of 3D sampling. Specifically, we use a voxel tubelization to represent a voxel grid as a set of tubes along any one of the X, Y, or Z axes. Each tube can be indexed by its 2D coordinates on the plane spanned by the other two axes. We further simplify each tube into a sequence of occupancy segments. Each occupancy segment consists of successive voxels occupied by the shape, which leads to a simple representation of its 1D start and end location. Given the 2D coordinates of the tube and a shape feature as condition, this representation enables us to learn 3D shape structures by sequentially predicting the start and end locations of each occupancy segment in the tube. We implement this approach using a Seq2Seq model with attention, called SeqXY2SeqZ, which learns the mapping from a sequence of 2D coordinates along two arbitrary axes to a sequence of 1D locations along the third axis. SeqXY2SeqZ not only benefits from the regularity of voxel grids in training and testing, but also achieves high memory efficiency. Our experiments show that SeqXY2SeqZ outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under the widely used benchmarks.",

We propose that this problem can be solved by explicitly modeling the deep feature distribution, for example as a Gaussian Mixture, and then properly introducing the likelihood regularization into the loss function. Specifically, by maximizing the likelihood of features of clean data and minimizing that of adversarial examples simultaneously, the neural network learns a more reasonable feature distribution in which the intrinsic difference between clean data and adversarial examples can be explicitly preserved. We call such a new robust training strategy the adversarial training with bi-directional likelihood regularization (ATBLR) method.

		"title": "Towards Content-Independent Multi-Reference Super-Resolution: Adaptive Pattern Matching and Feature Aggregation",
		"abstract": "Recovering realistic textures from a largely down-sampled low resolution (LR) image with complicated patterns is a challenging problem in image super-resolution. This work investigates a novel multi-reference based super-resolution problem by proposing a Content Independent Multi-Reference Super-Resolution (CIMR-SR) model, which is able to adaptively match the visual pattern between references and target image in the low resolution and enhance the feature representation of the target image in the higher resolution. CIMR-SR significantly improves the flexibility of the recently proposed reference-based super-resolution (RefSR), which needs to select the specific high-resolution reference (e.g., content similarity, camera view and relative scale) for each target image. In practice, a universal reference pool (RP) is built up for recovering all LR targets by searching the local matched patterns. By exploiting feature-based patch searching and attentive reference feature aggregation, the proposed CIMR-SR generates realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer fine-details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed CIMR-SR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative reconstructions.",

However, the inference process through intermediate layers is opaque, making it difficult to interpret such networks or develop trust in their operation. We propose to model the network hidden layers activity using probabilistic models. The activity patterns in layers of interest are modeled as Gaussian mixture models, and transition probabilities between clusters in consecutive modeled layers are estimated. Based on maximum-likelihood considerations, a subset of the nodes and paths relevant for network prediction are chosen, connected, and visualized as an inference graph. We show that such graphs are useful for understanding the general inference process of a class, as well as explaining decisions the network makes regarding specific images. In addition, the models provide an interesting observation regarding the highly local nature of column activities in top CNN layers.",

		"title": "Improving Query Efficiency of Black-box Adversarial Attack",
		"abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated excellent performance on various tasks, however they are under the risk of adversarial examples that can be easily generated when the target model is accessible to an attacker (white-box setting). As plenty of machine learning models have been deployed via online services that only provide query outputs from inaccessible models (e.g., Google Cloud Vision API2), black-box adversarial attacks (inaccessible target model) are of critical security concerns in practice rather than white-box ones. However, existing query-based black-box adversarial attacks often require excessive model queries to maintain a high attack success rate. Therefore, in order to improve query efficiency, we explore the distribution of adversarial examples around benign inputs with the help of image structure information characterized by a Neural Process, and propose a Neural Process based black-box adversarial attack (NP-Attack) in this paper. Extensive experiments show that NP-Attack could greatly decrease the query counts and achieve the highest attack success rate simultaneously under the black-box setting.",

		"title": "Self-similarity Student for Partial Label Histopathology Image Segmentation",
		"abstract": "Delineation of cancerous regions in gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) is a crucial diagnostic procedure in digital pathology. This process is time-consuming because of the large search space in the gigapixel WSIs, causing chances of omission and misinterpretation at indistinct tumor lesions. To tackle this, the development of an automated cancerous region segmentation method is imperative. We frame this issue as a modeling problem with partial label WSIs, where some cancerous regions may be misclassified as benign and vice versa, producing patches with noisy labels. To learn from these patches, we propose Self-similarity Student, combining teacher-student model paradigm with similarity learning. Specifically, for each patch, we first sample its similar and dissimilar patches according to spatial distance. A teacher-student model is then introduced, featuring the exponential moving average on both student model weights and teacher predictions ensemble. While our student model takes patches, teacher model takes all their corresponding similar and dissimilar patches for learning robust representation against noisy label patches. Following this similarity learning, our similarity ensemble merges similar patches’ ensembled predictions as the pseudo-label of a given patch to counteract its noisy label. On the CAMELYON16 dataset, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art noise-aware learning methods by 5% and the supervised-trained baseline by 10% in various degrees of noise. Moreover, our method is superior to the baseline on our TVGH TURP dataset with 2% improvement, demonstrating the generalizability to more clinical histopathology segmentation tasks.",

		"abstract": "We present BioMetricNet: a novel framework for deep unconstrained face verification which learns a regularized metric to compare facial features. Differently from popular methods such as FaceNet, the proposed approach does not impose any specific metric on facial features; instead, it shapes the decision space by learning a latent representation in which matching and non-matching pairs are mapped onto clearly separated and well-behaved target distributions. In particular, the network jointly learns the best feature representation, and the best metric that follows the target distributions, to be used to discriminate face images. In this paper we present this general framework, first of its kind for facial verification, and tailor it to Gaussian distributions. This choice enables the use of a simple linear decision boundary that can be tuned to achieve the desired trade-off between false alarm and genuine acceptance rate, and leads to a loss function that can be written in closed form. Extensive analysis and experimentation on publicly available datasets such as Labeled Faces in the wild (LFW), Youtube faces (YTF), Celebrities in Frontal-Profile in the Wild (CFP), and challenging datasets like cross-age LFW (CALFW), cross-pose LFW (CPLFW), In-the-wild Age Dataset (AgeDB) show a significant performance improvement and confirms the effectiveness and superiority of BioMetricNet over existing state-of-the-art methods.",

		"abstract": "The recently developed burst denoising approach, which reduces noise by using multiple frames captured in a short time, has demonstrated much better denoising performance than its single-frame counterparts. However, existing learning based burst denoising methods are limited by two factors. On one hand, most of the models are trained on video sequences with synthetic noise. When applied to real-world raw image sequences, visual artifacts often appear due to the different noise statistics. On the other hand, there lacks a real-world burst denoising benchmark of dynamic scenes because the generation of clean ground-truth is very difficult due to the presence of object motions. In this paper, a novel multi-frame CNN model is carefully designed, which decouples the learning of motion from the learning of noise statistics. Consequently, an alternating learning algorithm is developed to learn how to align adjacent frames from a synthetic noisy video dataset, and learn to adapt to the raw noise statistics from real-world noisy datasets of static scenes. Finally, the trained model can be applied to real-world dynamic sequences for burst denoising. Extensive experiments on both synthetic video datasets and real-world dynamic sequences demonstrate the leading burst denoising performance of our proposed method.",

		"abstract": "In order to summarize a content video properly, it is important to grasp the sequential structure of video as well as the long-term dependency between frames. The necessity of them is more obvious, especially for unsupervised learning. One possible solution is to utilize a well-known technique in the field of natural language processing for long-term dependency and sequential property: self-attention with relative position embedding (RPE). However, compared to natural language processing, video summarization requires capturing a much longer length of the global context. In this paper, we therefore present a novel input decomposition strategy, which samples the input both globally and locally. This provides an effective temporal window for RPE to operate and improves overall computational efficiency significantly. By combining both Global-and-Local input decomposition and RPE together, we come up with GL-RPE. Our approach allows the network to capture both local and global interdependencies between video frames effectively. Since GL-RPE can be easily integrated into the existing methods, we apply it to two different unsupervised backbones. We provide extensive ablation studies and visual analysis to verify the effectiveness of the proposals. We demonstrate our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance using the recently proposed rank order-based metrics: Kendall's $ au$ and Spearman's $\rho$. Furthermore, despite our method is unsupervised, we show ours perform on par with the fully-supervised method.",

		"title": "SPARK: Spatial-aware Online Incremental Attack Against Visual Tracking",
		"abstract": "Adversarial attacks of deep neural networks have been intensively studied on image, audio, natural language, patch, and pixel classification tasks. Nevertheless, as a typical, while important real-world application, the adversarial attacks of online video object tracking that traces an object's moving trajectory instead of its category are rarely explored. In this paper, we identify a new task for the adversarial attack to visual tracking: online generating imperceptible perturbations that mislead trackers along with an incorrect (Untargeted Attack, UA) or specified trajectory (Targeted Attack, TA). To this end, we first propose a spatial-aware basic attack by adapting existing attack methods, \\ie, FGSM, BIM, and C\\&W, and comprehensively analyze the attacking performance. We identify that online object tracking poses two new challenges: 1) it is difficult to generate imperceptible perturbations that can transfer across frames, and 2) real-time trackers require the attack to satisfy a certain level of efficiency. To address these challenges, we further propose the spatial-aware online incremental attack (a.k.a. SPARK) that performs spatial-temporal sparse incremental perturbations online and makes the adversarial attack less perceptible. In addition, as an optimization-based method, SPARK quickly converges to very small losses within several iterations by considering historical incremental perturbations, making it much more efficient than basic attacks. The in-depth evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers (i.e., SiamRPN++ with AlexNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet-50, and SiamDW) on OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT demonstrates the effectiveness and transferability of SPARK in misleading the trackers under both UA and TA with minor perturbations.",

		"title": "Fixing Localization Errors to Improve Image Classification",
		"abstract": "Deep neural networks are generally considered black-box models that offer less interpretability for their decision process. To address this limitation, Class Activation Map (CAM) provides an attractive solution that visualizes class-specific discriminative regions in an input image. The remarkable ability of CAMs to locate class discriminating regions has been exploited in weakly-supervised segmentation and localization tasks. In this work, we explore a new direction towards the possible use of CAM in deep network learning process. We note that such visualizations lend insights into the workings of deep CNNs and could be leveraged to introduce additional constraints during the learning stage. Specifically, the CAMs for negative classes (negative CAMs) often have false activations even though those classes are absent from an image. Thereby, we propose a loss function that seeks to minimize peaks within the negative CAMs, called Homogeneous Negative CAM loss. This way, in an effort to fix localization errors, our loss provides an extra supervisory signal that helps the model to better discriminate between similar classes. Our designed loss function is easy to implement and can be readily integrated into existing DNNs. We evaluate it on a number of classification tasks including large-scale recognition, multi-label classification and fine-grained recognition. Our loss provides better performance compared to other loss functions across the studied tasks.

In this paper we propose a novel anchor assignment strategy that adaptively separates anchors into positive and negative samples for a ground truth bounding box according to the model's learning status such that it is able to reason the separation in a probabilistic manner. To do so we first calculate the score of anchors conditioned on the model's learning status and fit these scores to a probability distribution.

Moreover, We investigate the gap between objectives of training and testing and propose to predict Intersection-over-Unions of detected boxes as a measure of the localization quality to reduce the discrepancy. The combined score of classification and localization qualities serving as a box selection metric in non-maximum suppression well aligns with the proposed anchor assignment strategy and leads significant performance improvements.

In this work, we first empirically find the recognition accuracy is highly correlated with the bounding box size of an actor, and thus higher resolution of actors contributes to better performance. However, video models require dense sampling in time to achieve accurate recognition. To fit in GPU memory, the frames to backbone network must be kept low-resolution, resulting in a coarse feature map in RoI-Pooling layer. Thus, we revisit RCNN for actor-centric action recognition via cropping and resizing image patches around actors before feature extraction with I3D deep network. Moreover, we found that expanding actor bounding boxes slightly and fusing the context features can further boost the performance. Consequently, we develop a surpringly effective baseline (Context-Aware RCNN) and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on two challenging action detection benchmarks of AVA and JHMDB.

This paper combines zero-distribution of AoP, the difference of Degree of linear Polarization (DoP), and the edge information to segment the road region in the scene. We developed a LWIR DoFP Dataset of Road Scene (LDDRS) consisting of 2,113 annotated images. Experiment results on the LDDRS dataset demonstrate the merits of the proposed road detection method based on the zero-distribution prior. The LDDRS dataset is available at https://github.com/polwork/LDDRS",

		"title": "A Flexible Recurrent Residual Pyramid Network for Video Frame Interpolation",
		"abstract": "Video frame interpolation (VFI) aims at synthesizing new video frames in-between existing frames to generate smoother high frame rate videos. Current methods usually use the fixed pre-trained networks to generate interpolated-frames for different resolutions and scenes. However, the fixed pre-trained networks are difficult to be tailored for a variety of cases. Inspired by classical pyramid energy minimization optical flow algorithms, this paper proposes a recurrent residual pyramid network (RRPN) for video frame interpolation. In the proposed network, different pyramid levels share the same weights and base-network, named recurrent residual layer (RRL). In RRL, residual displacements between warped images are detected to gradually refine optical flows rather than directly predict the flows or frames. Owing to the flexible recurrent residual pyramid architecture, we can customize the number of pyramid levels, and make trade-offs between calculations and quality based on the application scenarios. Moreover, occlusion masks are also generated in this recurrent residual way to solve occlusion better. Finally, a refinement network is added to enhance the details for final output with contextual and edge information. Experimental results demonstrate that the RRPN is more flexible and efficient than current VFI networks but has fewer parameters. In particular, the RRPN, which avoid over-reliance on datasets and network structures, shows superior performance for large motion cases.",

		"title": "Learning Enriched Features for Real Image Restoration and Enhancement",
		"abstract": "With the goal of recovering high-quality image content from its degraded version, image restoration enjoys numerous applications, such as in surveillance, computational photography and medical imaging. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved dramatic improvements over conventional approaches for image restoration task. Existing CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution or on progressively low-resolution representations. In the former case, spatially precise but contextually less robust results are achieved, while in the latter case, semantically reliable but spatially less accurate outputs are generated. In this paper, we present an architecture with the collective goals of maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the entire network and receiving strong contextual information from the low-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale residual block containing several key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) spatial and channel attention mechanisms for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention based multi-scale feature aggregation. In a nutshell, our approach learns an enriched set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales, while simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details. Extensive experiments on five real image benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method, named as MIRNet, achieves state-of-the-art results for image denoising, super-resolution, and image enhancement.

In this work, instead of using a global feature to recover the whole complete surface, we explore multi-level features by hierarchical feature learning and represent the existing-part and the missing-part respectively. We propose two different feature aggregation strategies, named global & local feature aggregation(GLFA) and residual feature aggregation(RFA), to express the two parts features and reconstruct coordinates from the combined features. In addition, we also design a refinement component to prevent the generated point from non-uniform distribution and outliers.

The difficulty is added when objects are represented by 3D point clouds, with variations in shape and semantic parts and unknown coordinate frames.

This paper aims at learning such 3D keypoints, in an unsupervised manner, using a collection of misaligned 3D point clouds of objects from an unknown category. In order to do so, we model shapes defined by the keypoints, within a category, using the symmetric linear basis shapes without assuming the plane of symmetry to be known. The usage of symmetry prior leads us to learn stable keypoints suitable for higher misalignments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on learning such keypoints directly from 3D point clouds for a general category. Using objects from four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the quality of our learned keypoints by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

However, their heavy memory cost and computation overhead significantly restrict their practical deployments on resource-limited devices, which mainly arise from the floating-point storage and operations between weights and activations. Although previous endeavors mainly resort to fixed-point operations, quantizing both weights and activations with fixed coding lengths may cause significant performance drop, especially on low bits. Specifically, most state-of-the-art SR models without batch normalization have a large dynamic quantization range, which also serves as another cause of performance drop. To address these two issues, we propose a new quantization scheme termed PArameterized Max Scale (PAMS), which applies the trainable truncated parameter to explore the upper bound of the quantization range adaptively. Finally, a structured knowledge transfer (SKT) loss is introduced to fine-tune the quantized network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PAMS scheme can well compress and accelerate the existing SR models such as EDSR and RDN.

Even a small amount of outliers can dramatically degrade the quality of the estimated blur kernel, because the outliers are not conforming to the linear formation of the blurring process. Prior arts develop sophisticated edge-selecting steps or noise filtering pre-processing steps to deal with outliers (i.e. indirect approaches). However, these indirect approaches may fail when massive outliers are presented, since informative details may be polluted by outliers or erased during the pre-processing steps. To address these problems, this paper develops a simple yet effective Outlier Identifying and Discarding (OID) method, which alleviates limitations in existing Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)- based deblurring models when significant outliers are presented. Unlike previous indirect outlier processing methods, OID tackles outliers directly by explicitly identifying and discarding them, when updating both the latent image and the blur kernel during the deblurring process, where the outliers are detected by using the sparse and entropy-based modules. OID is easy to implement and extendable for non-blind restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OID against recent works both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

On the other hand settings where 3D shape must be inferred for new categories with few examples are more natural and require models that generalize about shapes. In this work we demonstrate experimentally that naive baselines do not apply when the goal is to learn to reconstruct novel objects using very few examples, and that in a \u001bmph{few-shot} learning setting, the network must learn concepts that can be applied to new categories, avoiding rote memorization. To address deficiencies in existing approaches to this problem, we propose three approaches that efficiently integrate a class prior into a 3D reconstruction model, allowing to account for intra-class variability and imposing an implicit compositional structure that the model should learn. Experiments on the popular ShapeNet database demonstrate that our method significantly outperform existing baselines on this task in the few-shot setting.",

To this end, we cast video summarization as a graph modeling problem. We propose recursive graph modeling networks for video summarization, termed SumGraph, to represent a relation graph, where frames are regarded as nodes and nodes are connected by semantic relationships among frames. Our networks accomplish this through a recursive approach to refine an initially estimated graph to correctly classify each node as a keyframe by reasoning the graph representation via graph convolutional networks.

Noticing different samples suffer from varying intensities of label noise, we further propose a simple yet effective feature normalized knowledge distillation which introduces the sample specific correction factor to replace the unified temperature T for better reducing the impact of noise.

		"title": "Embedding Propagation: Smoother Manifold for Few-Shot Classification",
		"abstract": "Few-shot classification is challenging because the data distribution of the training set can be widely different to the test set as their classes are disjoint. This distribution shift often results in poor generalization. Manifold smoothing has been shown to address the distribution shift problem by extending the decision boundaries and reducing the noise of the class representations. Moreover, manifold smoothness is a key factor for semi-supervised learning and transductive learning algorithms. In this work, we propose to use embedding propagation as an unsupervised non-parametric regularizer for manifold smoothing in few-shot classification. Embedding propagation leverages interpolations between the extracted features of a neural network based on a similarity graph. We empirically show that embedding propagation yields a smoother embedding manifold. We also show that applying embedding propagation to a transductive classifier achieves new state-of-the-art results in extit{mini}Imagenet, extit{tiered}Imagenet, Imagenet-FS, and CUB. Furthermore, we show that embedding propagation consistently improves the accuracy of the models in multiple semi-supervised learning scenarios by up to 16\\% points. The proposed embedding propagation operation can be easily integrated as a non-parametric layer into a neural network. We provide the training code and usage examples at https://github.com/ElementAI/embedding-propagation.",

		"abstract": "Many object pose estimation algorithms rely on the analysis-by-synthesis framework which requires explicit representations of individual object instances. In this paper we combine a gradient-based fitting procedure with a parametric neural image synthesis module that is capable of implicitly representing the appearance, shape and pose of entire object categories, thus rendering the need for explicit CAD models per object instance unnecessary. The image synthesis network is designed to efficiently span the pose configuration space so that model capacity can be used to capture the shape and local appearance (i.e., texture) variations jointly. At inference time the synthesized images are compared to the target via an appearance based loss and the error signal is backpropagated through the network to the input parameters, i.e. poses and appearances. Keeping the network parameters fixed, this allows for iterative optimization of the object pose, shape and appearance in a joint manner and we experimentally show that the method can recover orientation of objects with high accuracy from 2D images alone. When provided with depth measurements, to overcome scale ambiguities, the method can accurately recover the full 6DOF pose successfully.",

Despite recent advances in disentangled representation learning, existing approaches often suffer from the trade-off between representation learning and generation performance (i.e. improving generation quality sacrifices disentanglement performance). We propose an Information-Distillation Generative Adversarial Network (ID-GAN), a simple yet generic framework that can easily incorporate the existing state-of-the-art models for both disentanglement learning and high-fidelity synthesis. Our method learns disentangled representation using VAE-based models, and distills the learned representation together with additional nuisance variable to the separate GAN-based generator for high-fidelity synthesis. To ensure that both generative models are aligned to render the same generative factors, we additionally constrain the GAN generator to maximize the mutual information between the learned latent code and the output. Despite the simplicity, we show that the proposed method is surprisingly effective, achieving comparable image generation quality to the state-of-the-arts using the disentangled representation. We also show that the proposed decomposition leads to efficient and stable model design, and demonstrate it on high-resolution image synthesis task (1024x1024 pixels) for the first time using the disentangled representations.",

In this paper, we propose a novel Prediction, Recovery and Identification (PRI) model for LR re-id, which adaptively recovers missing details by predicting a preferable scale factor based on the image content. To deal with the lack of ground-truth optimal scale factors, our model contains a self-supervised scale factor metric that automatically generates dynamic soft labels. The generated labels indicate probabilities that each scale factor is optimal, which are used as guidance to enhance the content-aware scale factor prediction. Consequently, our model can more accurately predict and recover the content-aware details, and achieve state-of-the-art performances on four LR re-id datasets.",

		"title": "Neural Wireframe Renderer: Learning Wireframe to Image Translations",

However, unlike a full design file, a wireframe model lacks critical information, such as detailed shape, texture, and materials, needed by a conventional renderer to produce 2D renderings of the objects or scenes. In this paper, we bridge the information gap by generating photo-realistic rendering of indoor scenes from wireframe models in an image translation framework. While existing image synthesis methods can generate visually pleasing images for common objects such as faces and birds, these methods do not explicitly model and preserve essential structural constraints in a wireframe model, such as junctions, parallel lines, and planar surfaces. To this end, we propose a novel model based on a structure-appearance joint representation learned from both images and wireframes. In our model, structural constraints are explicitly enforced by learning a joint representation in a shared encoder network that must support the generation of both images and wireframes. Experiments on a wireframe-scene dataset show that our wireframe-to-image translation model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and structural integrity of generated images.",

		"title": "RBF-Softmax: Learning Deep Representative Prototypes with Radial Basis Function Softmax",
		"abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable successes in learning feature representations for visual classification. However, deep features learned by the softmax cross-entropy loss generally show excessive intra-class variations. We argue that, because the traditional softmax losses aim to optimize only the relative differences between intra-class and inter-class distances (logits), it cannot obtain representative class prototypes (class weights/centers) to regularize intra-class distances, even when the training is converged. Previous efforts mitigate this problem by introducing auxiliary regularization losses. But these modified losses mainly focus on optimizing intra-class compactness, while ignoring keeping reasonable relations between different class prototypes. These lead to weak models and eventually limit their performance. To address this problem, this paper introduces a novel Radial Basis Function (RBF) distances to replace the commonly used inner products in the softmax loss function, such that it can adaptively assign losses to regularize the intra-class and inter-class distances by reshaping the relative differences, and thus creating more representative prototypes of classes to improve optimization. The proposed RBF-Softmax loss function not only effectively reduces intra-class distances, stabilizes the training behavior, and reserves ideal relations between prototypes, but also significantly improves the testing performance. Experiments on visual recognition benchmarks including MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed RBF-Softmax achieves better results than cross-entropy and other state-of-the-art classification losses.

In addition to the standard cycle-consistency and adversarial losses, we introduce a new hybrid discriminator, which is trained to classify the intermediate images produced by the generator as weighted hybrids, with weights based on a predetermined hop count.

Achieving this level of details is key for a number of applications that require understanding the interactions of the people with each other or with the environment. The main challenge is the lack of in-the-wild data with labeled whole-body 3D poses. In previous work, training data has been annotated or generated for simpler tasks focusing on bodies, hands or faces separately. In this work, we propose to take advantage of these datasets to train independent experts for each part, namely a body, a hand and a face expert, and distill their knowledge into a single deep network designed for whole-body 2D-3D pose detection. In practice, given a training image with partial or no annotation, each part expert detects its subset of keypoints in 2D and 3D and the resulting estimations are combined to obtain whole-body pseudo ground-truth poses. A distillation loss encourages the whole-body predictions to mimic the experts' outputs. Our results show that this approach significantly outperforms the same whole-body model trained without distillation while staying close to the performance of the experts. Importantly, DOPE is computationally less demanding than the ensemble of experts and can achieve real-time performance.

Though have no mode collapse/mixture, the generated images by AE-OT are blurry. In this paper, we propose the AE-OT-GAN model to utilize the advantages of the both models: generate high quality images and at the same time overcome the mode collapse/mixture problems.

Finally, our GAN model is trained to generate high quality images from the latent distribution induced by the extended SDOT map. The distribution transform map from this dataset related latent distribution to the data distribution will be continuous, and thus can be well approximated by the continuous DNNs. Additionally, the paired data between the latent codes and the real images gives us further restriction about the genera-tor and stabilizes the training process.

Invariance implies a selectivity for high level, relevant correlations w.r.t. class label annotations, and a robustness to irrelevant correlations with protected characteristics such as race or gender. We introduce a non-trivial setup in which the training set exhibits a strong bias such that class label annotations are irrelevant and spurious correlations cannot be distinguished. To address this problem, we introduce an adversarially trained model with a null-sampling procedure to produce invariant representations in the data domain. To enable disentanglement, a partially-labelled representative set is used. By placing the representations into the data domain, the changes made by the model are easily examinable by human auditors. We show the effectiveness of our method on both image and tabular datasets: Coloured MNIST, the CelebA and the Adult dataset.",

In recent works, those priors have been learned in an end-to-end manner from large datasets by using deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose guiding depth estimation to favor planar structures that are ubiquitous especially in indoor environments. This is achieved by incorporating a non-local coplanarity constraint to the network with a novel attention mechanism called depth-attention volume (DAV). Experiments on two popular indoor datasets, namely NYU-Depth-v2 and ScanNet, show that our method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation results while using only a fraction of the number of parameters needed by the competing methods.",

		"abstract": "with Neural 3D Mapping\",\"We hypothesize that an agent that can look around in static scenes can learn rich visual representations applicable to 3D object tracking in complex dynamic scenes. We are motivated in this pursuit by the fact that the physical world itself is mostly static, and multiview correspondence labels are relatively cheap to collect in static scenes, e.g., by triangulation. We propose to leverage multiview data of static points in arbitrary scenes (static or dynamic), to learn a neural 3D mapping module which produces features that are correspondable across time. The neural 3D mapper consumes RGB-D data as input, and produces a 3D voxel grid of deep features as output. We train the voxel features to be correspondable across viewpoints, using a contrastive loss, and correspondability across time emerges automatically. At test time, given an RGB-D video with approximate camera poses, and given the 3D box of an object to track, we track the target object by generating a map of each timestep and locating the object's features within each map. In contrast to models that represent video streams in 2D or 2.5D, our model's 3D scene representation is disentangled from projection artifacts, is stable under camera motion, and is robust to partial occlusions. We test the proposed architectures in challenging simulated and real data, and show that our unsupervised 3D object trackers outperform prior unsupervised 2D and 2.5D trackers, and approach the accuracy of supervised trackers. This work demonstrates that 3D object trackers can emerge without tracking labels, through multiview self-supervision on static data.",

This setting is of great practical value due to the existence of many off-the-shelf detection datasets. To more effectively utilize the source dataset, we propose to iteratively transfer the knowledge from the source domain by a one-class universal detector and learn the target-domain detector. The box-level pseudo ground truths mined by the target-domain detector in each iteration effectively improve the one-class universal detector. Therefore, the knowledge in the source dataset is more thoroughly exploited and leveraged. Extensive experiments are conducted with Pascal VOC 2007 as the target weakly-annotated dataset and COCO/ImageNet as the source fully-annotated dataset. With the proposed solution, we achieved an mAP of $59.7\\%$ detection performance on the VOC test set and an mAP of $60.2\\%$ after retraining a fully supervised Faster RCNN with the mined pseudo ground truths. This is significantly better than any previously known results in related literature and sets a new state-of-the-art of weakly supervised object detection under the knowledge transfer setting.",

Our core observation is that for certain tasks, such as image recognition, datasets are plentiful. They exist in any interesting domain, simulated or real, and are easy to label and extend. We use these recognition datasets to link up a source and target domain to transfer models between them in a task distillation framework.

PatchAttack induces misclassifications by superimposing small textured patches on the input image. We parametrize the appearance of these patches by a dictionary of class-specific textures. This texture dictionary is learned by clustering Gram matrices of feature activations from a VGG backbone. PatchAttack optimizes the position and texture parameters of each patch using reinforcement learning. Our experiments show that PatchAttack achieves >99% success rate on ImageNet for a wide range of architectures, while only manipulating 3% of the image for non-targeted attacks and 10% on average for targeted attacks.

Recently, the notion of single-source open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) has drawn much attention which considers the presence of previously unseen open-set (unknown) classes in the target-domain in addition to the source-domain closed-set (known) classes. It is reasonable to assume that labeled samples may be distributed over multiple source-domains while the target-domain is equipped with both the closed-set and open-set data. However, the existing single-source OSDA techniques cannot be directly extended to such a multi-source scenario considering the inhomogeneities present among the different source-domains. As a remedy, we propose a novel adversarial learning-driven approach to deal with the MS-OSDA setup. Precisely, we model a shared feature space for all the domains while encouraging fine-grained alignment among the known-class samples. Besides, an adversarial learning strategy is followed to model the discriminator between the target-domain known and unknown classes. We validate our method on the Office-31, Office-Home, Office-CalTech, and Digits datasets and find our model to consistently outperform the relevant literature.",

		"title": "Neural Batch Sampling with Reinforcement Learning for Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection",
		"abstract": "We are interested in the detection and segmentation of anomalies in images where the anomalies are typically small (i.e., a small tear in woven fabric, broken pin of an IC chip). From a statistical learning point of view, anomalies have low occurrence probability and are not from the main modes of a data distribution. Learning a generative model of anomalous data from a natural distribution of data can be difficult because the data distribution is heavily skewed towards a large amount of non-anomalous data. When training a generative model on such imbalanced data using an iterative learning algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we observe an expected yet interesting trend in the loss values (a measure of the learned models performance) after each gradient update across data samples. Naturally, as the model sees more non-anomalous data during training, the loss values over a non-anomalous data sample decreases, while the loss values on an anomalous data sample fluctuates. In this work, our key hypothesis is that this change in loss values during training can be used as a feature to identify anomalous data. In particular, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm for anomaly detection and segmentation using an anomaly classifier that uses as input the extit{loss profile} of a data sample processed through an autoencoder. The loss profile is defined as a sequence of reconstruction loss values produced during iterative training. To amplify the difference in loss profiles between anomalous and non-anomalous data, we also introduce a Reinforcement Learning based meta-algorithm, which we call the neural batch sampler, to strategically sample training batches during autoencoder training. Experimental results on multiple datasets with a high diversity of textures and objects, often with multiple modes of defects within them, demonstrate the capabilities and effectiveness of our method when compared with existing state-of-the-art baselines.",

In contrast, when applying more general singular value penalties, such as weighted nuclear norm priors, direct optimization over the elements of the matrix is typically used. Due to non-differentiability of the resulting objective function, first order sub-gradient or splitting methods are predominantly used. While these offer rapid iterations it is well known that they become inefficent near the minimum due to zig-zagging and in practice one is therefore often forced to settle for an approximate solution.In this paper we show that more accurate results can in many cases be achieved with 2nd order methods. Our main result shows how to construct bilinear formulations, for a general class of regularizers including weighted nuclear norm penalties, that are provably equivalent to the original problems. With these formulations the regularizing function becomes twice differentiable and 2nd order methods can be applied.

This leads to the cross-domain few-shot learning problem, where there is a large shift between base and novel class domains. While investigations of the cross-domain few-shot scenario exist, these works are limited to natural images that still contain a high degree of visual similarity. No work yet exists that examines few-shot learning across different imaging methods seen in real world scenarios, such as aerial and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose the Broader Study of Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (BSCD-FSL) benchmark, consisting of image data from a diverse assortment of image acquisition methods.

The results demonstrate that state-of-art meta-learning methods are surprisingly outperformed by earlier meta-learning approaches, and all meta-learning methods underperform in relation to simple fine-tuning by 12.8% average accuracy. In some cases, meta-learning even underperforms networks with random weights. Performance gains previously observed with methods specialized for cross-domain few-shot learning vanish in this more challenging benchmark.

		"abstract": "Person re-identification (ReID) remains a challenging task in many real-word video analytics and surveillance applications, even though state-of-the-art accuracy has improved considerably with the advent of deep learning (DL) models trained on large image datasets. Given the shift in distributions that typically occurs between video data captured from the source and target domains, and absence of labeled data from the target domain, it is difficult to adapt a DL model for accurate recognition of target data. DL models for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) are commonly designed in the feature representation space. We argue that for pair-wise matchers that rely on metric learning, e.g., Siamese networks for person ReID, the UDA objective should consist in aligning pair-wise dissimilarity between domains, rather than aligning feature representations. Moreover, dissimilarity representations are more suitable for designing open-set ReID systems, where identities differ in the source and target domains. In this paper, we propose a novel Dissimilarity-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (D-MMD) loss for aligning pair-wise distances that can be optimized via gradient descent using relatively small batch sizes. From a person ReID perspective, the evaluation of D-MMD loss is straightforward since the tracklet information (provided by a person tracker) allows to label a distance vector as being either within-class (within-tracklet) or between-class (between-tracklet). This allows approximating the underlying distribution of target pair-wise distances for D-MMD loss optimization, and accordingly align source and target distance distributions. Empirical results with three challenging benchmark datasets show that the proposed D-MMD loss decreases as source and domain distributions become more similar. Extensive experimental evaluation also indicates that UDA methods that rely on the D-MMD loss can significantly outperform baseline and state-of-the-art UDA methods for person ReID. The dissimilarity space transformation allows to design reliable pair-wise matchers, without the common requirement for data augmentation and/or complex networks.

Those blocks freeze a certain portion of the parameters at every layer and replace the corresponding multipliers with fixed scalers. Fixing the weights reduces the silicon area, logic delay, and memory requirements, leading to significant savings in cost and power consumption. Unlike traditional layer-wise freezing approaches, SemifreddoNets make a profitable trade between the cost and flexibility by having some of the weights configurable at different scales and levels of abstraction in the model. Although fixing the topology and some of the weights somewhat limits the flexibility, we argue that the efficiency benefits of this strategy outweigh the advantages of a fully configurable model for many use cases. Furthermore, our system uses repeatable blocks, therefore it has the flexibility to adjust model complexity without requiring any hardware change. The hardware implementation of SemifreddoNets provides up to an order of magnitude reduction in silicon area and power consumption as compared to their equivalent implementation on a general-purpose accelerator.",

		"abstract": "The fact that deep neural networks are susceptible to crafted perturbations severely impacts the use of deep learning in certain domains of application. Among many developed defense models against such attacks, adversarial training emerges as the most successful method that consistently resists a wide range of attacks. In this work, based on an observation from a previous study that the representations of a clean data example and its adversarial examples become more divergent in higher layers of a deep neural net, we propose the Adversary Divergence Reduction Network which enforces local/global compactness and the clustering assumption over an intermediate layer of a deep neural network. We conduct comprehensive experiments to understand the isolating behavior of each component (i.e., local/global compactness and the clustering assumption) and compare our proposed model with state-of-the-art adversarial training methods. The experimental results demonstrate that augmenting adversarial training with our proposed components can further improve the robustness of the network, leading to higher unperturbed and adversarial predictive performances.",

The CNN is usually trained by minimizing pixel-wise losses, which is less than ideal to produce binary masks that preserve the road network's global connectivity. To address this issue, we introduce an Adversarial Learning (AL) strategy tailored for our purposes. A naive one would treat the segmentation network as a generator and would feed its output along with ground-truth segmentations to a discriminator. It would then train the generator and discriminator jointly. We will show that this is not enough because it does not capture the fact that most errors are local and need to be treated as such. Instead, we use a more sophisticated discriminator that returns a label pyramid describing what portions of the road network are correct at several different scales. This discriminator and the structured labels it returns are what gives our approach its edge and we will show that it outperforms state-of-the-art ones on the challenging RoadTracer dataset.",

One-shot re-identification, which uses a singular labeled tracklet for each identity along with a pool of unlabeled tracklets, is a potential candidate towards reducing this labeling effort. Current one-shot re-identification methods function by modeling the inter-relationships amongst the labeled and the unlabeled data, but fail to fully exploit such relationships that exist within the pool of unlabeled data itself. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Temporal Consistency Progressive Learning, which uses temporal coherence as a novel self-supervised auxiliary task in the one-shot learning paradigm to capture such relationships amongst the unlabeled tracklets. Optimizing two new losses, which enforce consistency on a local and global scale, our framework can learn learn richer and more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on two challenging video re-identification datasets - MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID - demonstrate that our proposed method is able to estimate the true labels of the unlabeled data more accurately by up to $8\\%$, and obtain significantly better re-identification performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art techniques.",

		"title": "Learning Data Augmentation Strategies for Object Detection",
		"abstract": "Much research on object detection focuses on building better model architectures and detection algorithms. Changing the model architecture, however, comes at the cost of adding more complexity to inference, making models slower. Data augmentation, on the other hand, doesn't add any inference complexity, but is insufficiently studied in object detection for two reasons. First it is more difficult to design plausible augmentation strategies for object detection than for classification, because one must handle the complexity of bounding boxes if geometric transformations are applied. Secondly, data augmentation attracts less research attention perhaps because it is believed to add less value and to transfer poorly compared to advances in network architectures. This paper serves two main purposes. First, we propose to use AutoAugment to design better data augmentation strategies for object detection because it can address the difficulty of designing them. Second, we use the method to assess the value of data augmentation in object detection and compare it against the value of architectures. Our investigation into data augmentation for object detection identifies two surprising results. First, by changing the data augmentation strategy to our method, AutoAugment for detection, we can improve RetinaNet with a ResNet-50 backbone from 36.7 to 39.0 mAP on COCO, a difference of +2.3mAP. This gain exceeds the gain achieved by switching the backbone from ResNet-50 to ResNet-101 (+2.1mAP), which incurs additional training and inference costs. The second surprising finding is that our strategies found on the COCO dataset transfer well to the PASCAL dataset to improve accuracy by +2.7mAP. These results together with our systematic studies of data augmentation call into question previous assumptions about the role and transferability of architectures versus data augmentation. In particular, changing the augmentation may lead to performance gains that are equally transferable as changing the underlying architecture.",

One common way is searching on a smaller proxy dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) and then transferring to the target task (e.g., ImageNet). These architectures optimized on proxy data are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. Another common way is learning with a smaller candidate set, which may require expert knowledge and indeed betrays the essence of NAS. In this paper, we present DA-NAS that can directly search the architecture for large-scale target tasks while allowing a large candidate set in a more efficient manner. Our method is based on an interesting observation that the learning speed for blocks in deep neural networks is related to the difficulty of recognizing distinct categories.

The edge attention module utilizes attention mechanism to highlight object and suppress background noise, and a supervised branch is devised to guide the network to focus on the edge of instances precisely. To evaluate the effectiveness, we conduct experiments on COCO dataset. Without bells and whistles, our approach achieves impressive and robust improvement compared to baseline models.

		"title": "Discriminative Partial Domain Adversarial Network",
		"abstract": "Domain adaptation (DA) has been a fundamental building block for Transfer Learning (TL) which assumes that source and target domain share the same label space. A more general and realistic setting is that the label space of target domain is a subset of the source domain, as termed by Partial domain adaptation (PDA). Previous methods typically match the whole source domain to target domain, which causes negative transfer due to the source-negative classes in source domain that does not exist in target domain. In this paper, a novel Discriminative Partial Domain Adversarial Network (DPDAN) is developed. We first propose to use hard binary weighting to differentiate the source-positive and source-negative samples in the source domain. The source-positive samples are those with labels shared by two domains, while the rest in the source domain are treated as source-negative samples. Based on the above binary relabeling strategy, our algorithm maximizes the distribution divergence between source-negative samples and all the others (source-positive and target samples), meanwhile minimizes domain shift between source-positive samples and target domain to obtain discriminative domain-invariant features. We empirically verify DPDAN can effectively reduce the negative transfer caused by source-negative classes, and also theoretically show it decreases negative transfer caused by domain shift. Experiments on four benchmark domain adaptation datasets show DPDAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Characteristic spectral features make many pure materials identifiable from their visible-to-infrared spectra, but quantifying their presence within a mixture is a challenging task due to nonlinearities and factors of variation. In this paper, spectral variation is considered from a physics-based approach and incorporated into an end-to-end spectral unmixing algorithm via differentiable programming. The dispersion model is introduced to simulate realistic spectral variation, and an efficient method to fit the parameters is presented. Then, this dispersion model is utilized as a generative model within an analysis-by-synthesis spectral unmixing algorithm. Further, a technique for inverse rendering using a convolutional neural network to predict parameters of the generative model is introduced to enhance performance and speed when training data is available. Results achieve state-of-the-art on both infrared and visible-to-near-infrared (VNIR) datasets, and show promise for the synergy between physics-based models and deep learning in hyperspectral unmixing in the future.",

Due to the big challenge in collecting large-scale animal face datasets, it is difficult to train a high-precision AFR model from scratch. In this work, we propose a novel Residual InterSpecies Equivariant Network (RiseNet) to deal with the animal face recognition task with limited training samples. First, we formulate a module called residual inter-species feature equivariant to make the feature distribution of animals face closer to the human. Second, according to the structural characteristic of animal face, the features of the upper and lower half faces are learned separately. We present an animal facial feature fusion module to treat the features of the lower half face as additional information, which improves the proposed RiseNet performance. Besides, an animal face alignment strategy is designed for the preprocessing of the proposed network, which further aligns with the human face image. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that our method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-arts.",

In this paper, we study this problem in the context of audio-conditioned visual synthesis -- a task that is important, for example, in occlusion reasoning. Specifically, our goal is to generate future video frames and their motion dynamics conditioned on audio and a few past frames. To tackle this problem, we present Sound2Sight, a deep variational framework, that is trained to learn a per frame stochastic prior conditioned on a joint embedding of audio and past frames. This embedding is learned via a multi-head attention-based audio-visual transformer encoder. The learned prior is then sampled to further condition a video forecasting module to generate future frames. The stochastic prior allows the model to sample multiple plausible futures that are consistent with the provided audio and the past context. Moreover, to improve the quality and coherence of the generated frames, we propose a multimodal discriminator that differentiates between a synthesized and a real audio-visual clip.

		"title": "D-CVF: Generating Joint Camera and LiDAR Features Using Cross-View Spatial Feature Fusion for 3D Object Detection",
		"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture for fusing camera and LiDAR sensors for 3D object detection. Because the camera and LiDAR sensor signals have different characteristics and distributions, fusing these two modalities is expected to improve both the accuracy and robustness of 3D object detection. One of the challenges presented by the fusion of cameras and LiDAR is that the spatial feature maps obtained from each modality are represented by significantly different views in the camera and world coordinates; hence, it is not an easy task to combine two heterogeneous feature maps without loss of information. To address this problem, we propose a method called 3D-CVF that combines the camera and LiDAR features using the cross-view spatial feature fusion strategy. First, the method employs auto-calibrated projection, to transform the 2D camera features to a smooth spatial feature map with the highest correspondence to the LiDAR features in the bird's eye view (BEV) domain. Then, a gated feature fusion network is applied to use the spatial attention maps to mix the camera and LiDAR features appropriately according to the region. Next, camera-LiDAR feature fusion is also achieved in the subsequent proposal refinement stage. The low-level LiDAR features and camera features are separately pooled using region of interest (RoI)-based feature pooling and fused with the joint camera-LiDAR features for enhanced proposal refinement. Our evaluation, conducted on the KITTI and nuScenes 3D object detection datasets, demonstrates that the camera-LiDAR fusion offers significant performance gain over the LiDAR-only baseline and that the proposed 3D-CVF achieves state-of-the-art performance in the KITTI benchmark.",

In the training stage, we train the network via meta-learning; thus, the network can quickly adapt to any input image at test time. Then, in the test stage, parameters of this meta-learned network are rapidly fine-tuned with only a few iterations by only using the given low-resolution image.

For large-scale point cloud segmentation, the extit{de facto} method is to project a 3D point cloud to get a 2D LiDAR image and use convolutions to process it. Despite the similarity between regular RGB and LiDAR images, we are the first to discover that the feature distribution of LiDAR images changes drastically at different image locations. Using standard convolutions to process such LiDAR images is problematic, as convolution filters pick up local features that are only active in specific regions in the image. As a result, the capacity of the network is under-utilized and the segmentation performance decreases. To fix this, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Convolution (SAC) to adopt different filters for different locations according to the input image. SAC can be computed efficiently since it can be implemented as a series of element-wise multiplications, im2col, and standard convolution. It is a general framework such that several previous methods can be seen as special cases of SAC.

However, they have an intrinsic problem of modeling the in-camera variability of images successfully, that is, pedestrian features extracted from the same camera tend to be clustered into the same class. This often results in a non-convergent model in the real world application of clustering based re-id models, leading to degenerated performance. In the present study, we propose an attention-driven two-stage clustering (ADTC) method to solve this problem. Specifically, our method consists of two strategies. Firstly, we use an unsupervised attention kernel to shift the learned features from the image background to the pedestrian foreground, which results in more informative clusters. Secondly, to aid the learning of the attention driven clustering model, we separate the clustering process into two stages. We first use kmeans to generate the centroids of clusters (stage 1) and then apply the k-reciprocal Jaccard distance (KRJD) metric to re-assign data points to each cluster (stage 2). By iteratively learning with the two strategies, the attentive regions are gradually shifted from the background to the foreground and the features become more discriminative. Using two benchmark datasets Market1501 and DukeMTMC, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches for person re-id.",

Here, we propose a different approach: a class-agnostic object pose transformation network (OPT-Net) can transform an image along 3D yaw and pitch axes to synthesize additional poses continuously. Synthesized images lead to better training of an object classifier. We design a novel eliminate-add structure to explicitly disentangle pose from object identity: first ‘eliminate’ pose information of the input image and then ‘add’ target pose information (regularized as continuous variables) to synthesize any target pose. We trained OPT-Net on images of toy vehicles shot on a turntable from the iLab-20M dataset. After training on unbalanced discrete poses (5 classes with 6 poses per object instance, plus 5 classes with only 2 poses), we show that OPT-Net can synthesize balanced continuous new poses along yaw and pitch axes with high quality. Training a ResNet-18 classifier with original plus synthesized poses improves mAP accuracy by 9% over training on original poses only. Further, the pre-trained OPT-Net can generalize to new object classes, which we demonstrate on both iLab-20M and RGB-D. We also show that the learned features can generalize to ImageNet.

For VMR, several methods that require full supervision for training have been proposed. Unfortunately, acquiring a large number of training videos with labeled temporal boundaries for each query is a labor-intensive process. This paper explores a method for performing VMR in a weakly-supervised manner (wVMR): training is performed without temporal moment labels but only with the text query that describes a segment of the video. Existing methods on wVMR generate multi-scale proposals and apply query-guided attention mechanism to highlight the most relevant proposal. To leverage the weak supervision, contrastive learning is used which predicts higher scores for the correct video-query pairs than for the incorrect pairs. It has been observed that a large number of candidate proposals, coarse query representation, and one-way attention mechanism lead to blurry attention map which limits the localization performance. To address this issue, Video-Language Alignment Network (VLANet) is proposed that learns a sharper attention by pruning out spurious candidate proposals and applying a multi-directional attention mechanism with fine-grained query representation. The Surrogate Proposal Selection module selects a proposal based on the proximity to the query in the joint embedding space, and thus substantially reduces candidate proposals which leads to lower computation load and sharper attention. Next, the Cascaded Cross-modal Attention module considers dense feature interactions and multi-directional attention flows to learn the multi-modal alignment. VLANet is trained end-to-end using contrastive loss which enforces semantically similar videos and queries to cluster.

Foregrounds within the same category can be grouped into a small number of patterns. Instances within each pattern are compatible with any query input interchangeably. These instances are referred to as interchangeable foregrounds. We first present a pipeline to build pattern-level FoS dataset containing labels of interchangeable foregrounds. We then establish a benchmark dataset for further training and testing following the pipeline. As for the proposed method, we first train a foreground encoder to learn representations of interchangeable foregrounds. We then train a query encoder to learn query-foreground compatibility following a knowledge distillation framework. It aims to transfer knowledge from interchangeable foregrounds to supervise representation learning of compatibility. The query feature representation is projected to the same latent space as interchangeable foregrounds, enabling very efficient and interpretable instance-level search. Furthermore, pattern-level search is feasible to retrieve more controllable, reasonable and diverse foregrounds.

This is because these require the simulation of light to be photorealistic, which in turn requires physically accurate modelling of geometry, materials, and light sources, for both the head and the surrounding scene. Non-photorealistic renders however are increasingly easy to produce. In contrast to computer graphics approaches, generative models learned from more readily available 2D image data have been shown to produce samples of human faces that are hard to distinguish from real data. The process of learning usually corresponds to a loss of control over the shape and appearance of the generated images. For instance, even simple disentangling tasks such as modifying the hair independently of the face, which is trivial to accomplish in a computer graphics approach, remains an open research question. In this work, we propose an algorithm that matches a non-photorealistic, synthetically generated image to a latent vector of a pretrained StyleGAN2 model which, in turn, maps the vector to a photorealistic image of a person of the same pose, expression, hair, and lighting. In contrast to most previous work, we require no synthetic training data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm of its kind to work at a resolution of 1K and represents a significant leap forward in visual realism.",

		"abstract": "Few-shot learning, namely recognizing novel categories with a very small amount of training examples, is a challenging area of machine learning research. Traditional deep learning methods require massive training data to tune the huge number of parameters, which is often impractical and prone to over-fitting. In this work, we further research on the well-known few-shot learning method known as prototypical networks for better performance. Our contributions include (1) a new embedding structure to encode relative spatial relationships between features by applying a capsule network; (2) a new triplet loss designated to enhance the semantic feature embedding where similar samples are close to each other while dissimilar samples are farther apart; and (3) an effective non-parametric classifier termed attentive prototypes in place of the simple prototypes in current few-shot learning. The proposed attentive prototype aggregates all of the instances in a support class which are weighted by their importance, defined by the reconstruction error for a given query. The reconstruction error allows the classification posterior probability to be estimated, which corresponds to the classification confidence score. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is effective for the few-shot classification task.",

The samples drawn from our conditional distribution provide accurate pseudo labels due to the use of semantic class aware unary terms, boundary aware pairwise smoothness terms, and annotation aware higher order terms. Furthermore, we represent the instance segmentation model as an annotation agnostic prediction distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our representation allows us to define a joint probabilistic learning objective that minimizes the dissimilarity between the two distributions.

In this work, we seek to exploit the deep attention mechanism to search for salient, distinctive and stable features that are good for long-term matching in the scene through a novel end-to-end deep neural network. Furthermore, our learned feature descriptors are demonstrated to be competent to establish robust matches and therefore successfully estimate the optimal camera poses with high precision. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of our method using a freshly collected dataset with high-quality ground truth trajectories and hardware synchronization between sensors.

Conventionally, spatial contexts are passively hidden in the CNN's increasing receptive fields or actively encoded by non-local convolution. Yet, the non-local spatial interactions are not across scales, and thus they fail to capture the non-local contexts of objects (or parts) residing in different scales. To this end, we propose a fully active feature interaction across both space and scales, called Feature Pyramid Transformer (FPT). It transforms any feature pyramid into another feature pyramid of the same size but with richer contexts, by using three specially designed transformers in self-level, top-down, and bottom-up interaction fashion. FPT serves as a generic visual backbone with fair computational overhead. We conduct extensive experiments in both instance-level (i.e., object detection and instance segmentation) and pixel-level segmentation tasks, using various backbones and head networks, and observe consistent improvement over all the baselines and the state-of-the-art methods.",

And then we design a combination of a pose-guided and mask-guided layer to generate saliency heatmap to further guide discriminative feature learning. More importantly, we propose a new matching approach, called Guided Adaptive Spatial Matching (GASM), which expects that each spatial feature in the query can find the most similar spatial features of a person in a gallery to match.

First, we design a flow ladder module (FLM) for the RGB stream to fully extract global and local information while maintaining the saliency details. This is achieved by constructing four detail-transfer branches, each of which preserves the detail information and receives global location information from representations of other vertical parallel branches in an evolutionary way. Second, we propose a novel depth attention module (DAM) to ensure depth features with high discriminative power in location and spatial structure being effectively utilized when combined with RGB features in challenging scenes. The depth features can also discriminatively guide the RGB features via our proposed DAM to precisely locate the salient objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance over 13 state-of-the-art RGB-D approaches on the 7 datasets. Our code will be publicly available.",

We promote an accurate learning of motion without human annotation by training a neural network to discriminate a video sequence from its temporally transformed versions. To learn to distinguish non-trivial motions, the design of the transformations is based on two principles: 1) To deﬁne clusters of motions based on time warps of diﬀerent magnitude; 2) To ensure that the discrimination is feasible only by observing and analyzing as many image frames as possible. Thus, we introduce the following transformations: forward-backward playback, random frame skipping, and uniform frame skipping.

		"title": "Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation for Night-time Images using Adversarial Domain Feature Adaptation",
		"abstract": "In this paper, we look into the problem of estimating per-pixel depth maps from unconstrained RGB monocular night-time images which is a difficult task that has not been addressed adequately in the literature. The state-of-the-art day-time depth estimation methods fail miserably when tested with night-time images due to a large domain shift between them. The usual photometric losses used for training these networks may not work for night-time images due to the absence of uniform lighting which is commonly present in day-time images, making it a difficult problem to solve. We propose to solve this problem by posing it as a domain adaptation problem where a network trained with day-time images is adapted to work for night-time images. Specifically, an encoder is trained to generate features from night-time images that are indistinguishable from those obtained from day-time images by using a PatchGAN-based adversarial discriminative learning method. Unlike the existing methods that directly adapt depth prediction (network output), we propose to adapt feature maps obtained from the encoder network so that a pre-trained day-time depth decoder can be directly used for predicting depth from these adapted features. Hence, the resulting method is termed as “Adversarial Domain Feature Adaptation (ADFA)” and its efficacy is demonstrated through experimentation on the challenging Oxford night driving dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work is a first of its kind to estimate depth from unconstrained night-time monocular RGB images that uses a completely unsupervised learning process. The modular encoder-decoder architecture for the proposed ADFA method allows us to use the encoder module as a feature extractor which can be used in many other applications. One such application is demonstrated where the features obtained from our adapted encoder network are shown to outperform other state-of-the-art methods in a visual place recognition problem, thereby, further establishing the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

These spiky distributions show inferior alignments and the non-blank symbols are not learned sufficiently. To remedy this, we propose variational CTC (Var-CTC) to enhance the learning of non-blank symbols. The proposed Var-CTC converts the output distribution of vanilla CTC with hierarchy distribution. It first learns the approximated posterior distribution of blank to determine whether to output a specific non-blank symbol or not. Then it learns the alignment between non-blank symbols and input sequence. Experiments on scene text recognition and offline handwritten text recognition show Var-CTC achieves better alignments. Besides, with the enhanced learning of non-blank symbols, the confidence scores of model outputs are more discriminative. Compared with the vanilla CTC, the proposed Var-CTC can improve the recall performance by a large margin when the models maintain the same level of precision.",

		"abstract": "As an important computer vision task, 3d human pose estimation in a multi-camera, multi-person setting has received widespread attention and many interesting applications have been derived from it. Traditional approaches use a 3d pictorial structure model to handle this task. However, these models suffer from high computation costs and result in low accuracy in joint detection. Recently, especially since the introduction of Deep Neural Networks, one popular approach is to build a pipeline that involves three separate steps: (1) 2d skeleton detection in each camera view, (2) identification of matched 2d skeletons and (3) estimation of the 3d poses. Many existing works operate by feeding the 2d images and camera parameters through the three modules in a cascade fashion. However, all three operations can be highly correlated. For example, the 3d generation results may affect the results of detection in step 1, as does the matching algorithm in step 2. To address this phenomenon, we propose a novel end-to-end training scheme that brings the three separate modules into a single model. However, one outstanding problem of doing so is that the matching algorithm in step 2 appears to disjoint the pipeline. Therefore, we take our inspiration from the recent success in Capsule Networks, in which its Dynamic Routing step is also disjointed, but plays a crucial role in deciding how gradients are flowed from the upper to the lower layers. Similarly, a dynamic matching module in our work also decides the paths in which gradients flow from step 3 to step 1. Furthermore, as a large number of cameras are present, the existing matching algorithm either fails to deliver a robust performance or can be very inefficient. Thus, we additionally propose a novel matching algorithm that can match 2d poses from multiple views efficiently. The algorithm is robust and able to deal with situations of incomplete and false 2d detection as well.",

Patterns are more robust to changes in data distribution, especially those that appear in the top layers. Features are extracted via an innovative cloning decomposition technique and then linked to each other to form stable complex patterns. Our model alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthens dynamic link propagation and substantially reduces the number of parameters.

Although its extended version, trace transform, allow us to construct affine invariants, they are less informative and computational expensive due to the loss of spatial relationship between trace lines and the extensive repeated calculation of transform. To address this issue, a novel line integral transform is proposed. We first use binding line pairs that have the desirable property of affine preserving as a reference frame to rewrite the diametrical dimension parameters of the lines in a relative manner which make them independent on affine transform. Along polar angle dimension of the line parameters, a moment-based normalization is then conducted to degrade the affine transform to similarity transform which can be easily normalized by Fourier transform. The proposed transform is not only invariant to affine transform, but also preserves the spatial relationship between line integrals which make it very informative. Another advantage of the proposed transform is that it is more efficient than the trace transform. Conducting it one time can allow us to achieve a 2D matrix of affine invariants. While conducting the trace transform once only generates a single feature and multiple trace transforms of different functionals are needed to derive more to make the descriptors informative. The effectiveness of the proposed transform has been validated on two types of standard shape test cases, affinely distorted contour shape dataset and region shape dataset, respectively.",

		"abstract": "Structure extraction from document images has been a long-standing research topic due to its high impact on a wide range of practical applications. In this paper, we share our findings on employing a hierarchical semantic segmentation network for this task of structure extraction. We propose a prior based deep hierarchical CNN network architecture that enables document structure extraction using very high resolution(1800 x 1000) images. We divide the document image into overlapping horizontal strips such that the network segments a strip and uses its prediction mask as prior for predicting the segmentation of the subsequent strip. We perform experiments establishing the effectiveness of our strip based network architecture through ablation methods and comparison with low-resolution variations. Further, to demonstrate our network's capabilities, we train it on only one type of documents (Forms) and achieve state-of-the-art results over other general document datasets. We introduce our new human-annotated forms dataset and show that our method significantly outperforms different segmentation baselines on this dataset in extracting hierarchical structures.Our method is currently being used in Adobe's AEM Forms for automated conversion of paper and PDF forms to modern HTML based forms.",

In this work, we test this assumption by quantifying to which extent gaze on recent video saliency benchmarks can be predicted by a static baseline model. On the recent LEDOV dataset, we find that at least 75% of the explainable information as defined by a gold standard model can be explained using static features. Our baseline model ``DeepGaze MR'' even outperforms state-of-the-art video saliency models, despite deliberately ignoring all temporal patterns. Visual inspection of our static baseline’s failure cases shows that clear temporal effects on human gaze placement exist, but are both rare in the dataset and not captured by any of the recent video saliency models. To focus the development of video saliency models on better capturing temporal effects we construct a meta-dataset consisting of those examples requiring temporal information.",

		"abstract": "Self-driving cars need to understand 3D scenes efficiently and accurately in order to drive safely. Given the limited hardware resources, existing 3D perception models are not able to recognize small instances (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists) very well due to the low-resolution voxelization and aggressive downsampling. To this end, we propose Sparse Point-Voxel Convolution (SPVConv), a lightweight 3D module that equips the vanilla Sparse Convolution with the high-resolution point-based branch. With negligible overhead, this point-based branch is able to preserve the fine details even from large outdoor scenes. To explore the spectrum of efficient 3D models, we first define a flexible architecture design space based on SPVConv, and we then present 3D Neural Architecture Search (3D-NAS) to search the optimal network architecture over this diverse design space efficiently and effectively. Experimental results validate that the resulting SPVNAS model is fast and accurate: it outperforms the state-of-the-art MinkowskiNet by 3.3%, ranking 1st on the competitive SemanticKITTI leaderboard. It also achieves 8-24× computation reduction and 3-35× measured speedup over MinkowskiNet and KPConv with higher accuracy. Finally, we transfer our method to 3D object detection, and it achieves consistent improvements over the one-stage detection baseline on KITTI.",

We show that these inconsistencies stem from design flaws that make the metrics insensitive to whole classes of errors. This insensitivity is undesirable in metrics intended for capturing overall general quality of road reconstructions. In particular, the scores do not reflect the time needed for a human to fix the errors, because each one has to be fixed individually. To provide more reliable evaluation, we design three new metrics that are sensitive to all classes of errors. This sensitivity makes them more consistent even though they use very different approaches to comparing ground-truth and reconstructed road networks.We use both synthetic and real data to demonstrate this and advocate the use of these corrected metrics as a tool to gauge future progress.",

As most, if not all, previous CL methods violate these constraints, we propose an algorithmic solution to MC-OCL: Batch-level Distillation (BLD), a regularization-based CL approach which effectively balances stability and plasticity in order to learn from data streams, while preserving the ability to solve old tasks through distillation. Our extensive experimental evaluation, conducted on three publicly available benchmarks, empirically demonstrates that our approach successfully addresses the MC-OCL problem and achieves comparable accuracy to prior distillation methods requiring higher memory overhead.",

In this work we overcome this assumption and we address the problem of transferring knowledge from a source to a target domain when both source and target data have no annotations. Inspired by recent works on deep clustering, our approach leverages information from data gathered from multiple source domains to build a domain-agnostic clustering model which is then refined at inference time when target data become available. Specifically, at training time we propose to optimize a novel information-theoretic loss which, coupled with domain-alignment layers, ensures that our model learns to correctly discover semantic labels while discarding domain-specific features. Importantly, our architecture design ensures that at inference time the resulting source model can be effectively adapted to the target domain without having access to source data, thanks to feature alignment and self-supervision. We evaluate the proposed approach in a variety of settings, considering several domain adaptation benchmarks and we show that our method is able to automatically discover relevant semantic information even in presence of few target samples and yields state-of-the-art results on multiple domain adaptation benchmarks.",

Within an individual pyramid level, we improve the cost volume construction process by departing from a warping- to a sampling-based strategy, which avoids ghosting and hence enables us to better preserve fine flow details. We further amplify the positive effects through a level-specific, loss max-pooling strategy that adaptively shifts the focus of the learning process on under-performing predictions. Our second contribution revises the gradient flow across pyramid levels. The typical operations performed at each pyramid level can lead to noisy, or even contradicting gradients across levels. We show and discuss how properly blocking some of these gradient components leads to improved convergence and ultimately better performance. Finally, we introduce a distillation concept to counteract the issue of catastrophic forgetting and thus preserving knowledge over models sequentially trained on multiple datasets. Our findings are conceptually simple and easy to implement, yet result in compelling improvements on relevant error measures that we demonstrate via exhaustive ablations on datasets like Flying Chairs2, Flying Things, Sintel and KITTI. We establish new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel and KITTI 2012 test datasets, and even show the portability of our findings to different optical flow and depth from stereo approaches.",

Recently, there have been some approaches that incorporate the problem setting of non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM) into deep learning to learn 3D structure reconstruction. The most important difficulty of NRSfM is to estimate both the rotation and deformation at the same time, and previous works handle this by regressing both of them. In this paper, we resolve this difficulty by proposing a loss function wherein the suitable rotation is automatically determined. Trained with the cost function consisting of the reprojection error and the low-rank term of aligned shapes, the network learns the 3D structures of such objects as human skeletons and faces during the training, whereas the testing is done in a single-frame basis. The proposed method can handle inputs with missing entries and experimental results validate that the proposed framework shows superior reconstruction performance to the state-of-the-art method on the Human 3.6M, 300-VW, and SURREAL dataset, even though the underlying network structure is very simple.",

To achieve efficient and flexible image classification at runtime, we employ meta learners to generate convolutional weights of main networks for various input scales and maintain privatized Batch Normalization layers per scale. For improved training performance, we further utilize knowledge distillation on the fly over model predictions based on different input resolutions. The learned meta network could dynamically parameterize main networks to act on input images of arbitrary size with consistently better accuracy compared to individually trained models. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet demonstrate that our method achieves an improved accuracy-efficiency trade-off during the adaptive inference process.

		"abstract": "Recent increase in the availability of warped images projected onto a manifold (e.g., omnidirectional spherical images), coupled with the success of higher-order assignment methods, has sparked an interest in the search for improved higher-order matching algorithms on warped images due to projection. Although currently, several existing methods “flatten\"\" such 3D images to use planar graph / hypergraph matching methods, they still suffer from severe distortions and other undesired artifacts, which result in inaccurate matching. Alternatively, current planar methods cannot be trivially extended to effectively match points on images warped onto manifolds. Hence, matching on these warped images persists as a formidable challenge. In this paper, we pose the assignment problem as finding a bijective map between two graph induced simplicial complexes, which are higher-order analogues of graphs. We propose a constrained quadratic assignment problem (QAP) that matches each p-skeleton of the simplicial complexes, iterating from the highest to the lowest dimension. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are illustrated on both synthetic and real-world spherical / warped (projected) images with known ground-truth correspondences.

Apart from the supervised training on the labeled data, the segmentation network is judged by an additional network. The secondary correction network learns on the labeled data to optimally spot correct predictions, as well as to amend incorrect ones. As auxiliary regularization term, the corrector directly influences the supervised training of the segmentation network.

We propose a novel curriculum learning approach for image classification that adapts the loss function by changing the label representation.

Gradually, this label representation is shifted towards the standard one-hot-encoding. That is, in the beginning minor mistakes are corrected less than large mistakes, resembling a teaching process in which broad concepts are explained first before subtle differences are taught. The class similarity can be based on prior knowledge. For the special case of the labels being natural words, we propose a generic way to automatically compute the similarities. The natural words are embedded into Euclidean space using a standard word embedding. The probability of each class is then a function of the cosine similarity between the vector representations of the class and the true label. The proposed label-similarity curriculum learning (LCL) approach was empirically evaluated using several popular deep learning architectures for image classification tasks applied to five datasets including ImageNet, CIFAR100, and AWA2.

		"abstract": "Inspired by the success of the CNN-RNN framework in the image captioning task, several works have explored this in multi-label image annotation with the hope that the RNN followed by a CNN would encode inter-label dependencies better than using a CNN alone. To do so, for each training sample, the earlier methods converted the ground-truth label-set into a sequence of labels based on their frequencies (e.g., rare-to-frequent) for training the RNN. However, since the ground-truth is an unordered set of labels, imposing a fixed and predefined sequence on them does not naturally align with this task. To address this, some of the recent papers have proposed techniques that are capable to train the RNN without feeding the ground-truth labels in a particular sequence/order. However, most of these techniques leave it to the RNN to implicitly choose one sequence for the ground-truth labels corresponding to each sample at the time of training, thus making it inherently biased. In this paper, we address this limitation and propose a novel approach in which the RNN is explicitly forced to learn multiple relevant inter-label dependencies, without the need of feeding the ground-truth in any particular order. Using thorough empirical comparisons, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques on two popular datasets (MS-COCO and NUS-WIDE). Additionally, it provides a new perspecitve of looking at an unordered set of labels as equivalent to a collection of different permutations (sequences) of those labels, thus naturally aligning with the image annotation task.

In this paper, we extrapolate those advances to the 3D domain, by studying 3D image-to-video translation with a particular focus on 4D facial expressions. Although 3D facial generative models have been widely explored during the past years, 4D animation remains relatively unexplored. To this end, in this study we employ a deep mesh encoder-decoder like architecture to synthesize realistic high resolution facial expressions by using a single neutral frame along with an expression identification. In addition, processing 3D meshes remains a non-trivial task compared to data that live on grid-like structures, such as images. Given the recent progress in mesh processing with graph convolutions, we make use of a recently introduced learnable operator which acts directly on the mesh structure by taking advantage of local vertex orderings.

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach preserves the subject's identity information even for unseen subjects and generates high quality expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study tackling the problem of 4D facial expression synthesis.",

To decompose such interference, we introduce the concept of Disentangled Feature Learning to achieve the feature-level divide-and-conquer of hybrid distortions. Specifically, we propose the feature disentanglement module (FDM) to distribute feature representations of different distortions into different channels by revising gain-control-based normalization. We also propose a feature aggregation module (FAM) with channel-wise attention to adaptively filter out the distortion representations and aggregate useful content information from different channels for the construction of raw image. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by visualizing the correlation matrix of features and channel responses of different distortions.

We propose a new weakly supervised method for training CNNs to segment an object of a single class of interest. Instead of ground truth, we guide training with a regularized loss function. Regularized loss models prior knowledge about the likely object shape properties and thus guides segmentation towards the more plausible shapes. Training CNNs with regularized loss is difficult. We develop an annealing strategy that is crucial for successful training. The advantage of our method is simplicity: we use standard CNN architectures and intuitive and computationally efficient loss function. Furthermore, we apply the same loss function for any task/dataset, without any tailoring. We first evaluate our approach for salient object segmentation and co-segmentation. These tasks naturally involve one object class of interest. In some cases, our results are only a few points of standard performance measure behind those obtained training the same CNN with full supervision, and state-of-the art results in weakly supervised setting. Then we adapt our approach to weakly supervised multi-class semantic segmentation and obtain state-of-the-art results.",

Generally, research on 3D face generation revolves around linear statistical models of the facial surface. Nevertheless, these models cannot represent faithfully either the facial texture or the normals of the face, which are very crucial for photo-realistic face synthesis. Recently, it was demonstrated that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used for generating high-quality textures of faces. Nevertheless, the generation process either omits the geometry and normals, or independent processes are used to produce 3D shape information. In this paper, we present the first methodology that generates high-quality texture, shape, and normals jointly, which can be used for photo-realistic synthesis. To do so, we propose a novel GAN that can generate data from different modalities while exploiting their correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how we can condition the generation on the expression and create faces with various facial expressions.

Such methods, however, do not scale well given the high burden of manual video annotation and a very large number of possible actions. The annotation is particularly difficult for temporal action localization where large parts of the video present no action, or background. To address these challenges, we here propose a self-supervised and generic method to isolate actions from their background. We build on the observation that actions often follow a particular temporal order and, hence, can be predicted by other actions in the same video. As consecutive actions might be separated by minutes, differently to prior work on the arrow of time, we here exploit long-range temporal relations in 10-20 minutes long videos. To this end, we propose a new model that learns actionness via a self-supervised proxy task of order verification. The model assigns high actionness scores to clips which order is easy to predict from other clips in the video. To obtain a powerful and action-agnostic model, we train it on the large-scale unlabeled HowTo100M dataset with highly diverse actions from instructional videos.

Many studies have been conducted to unify these modules into an end-to-end trainable model to achieve better performance. A typical architecture places detection and recognition modules into separate branches, and a RoI pooling is commonly used to let the branches share a visual feature. However, there still exists a chance of establishing a more complimentary connection between the modules when adopting recognizer that uses attention-based decoder and detector that represents spatial information of the character regions. This is possible since the two modules share a common sub-task which is to find the location of the character regions. Based on the insight, we construct a tightly coupled single pipeline model. This architecture is formed by utilizing detection outputs in the recognizer and propagating the recognition loss through the detection stage. The use of character score map helps the recognizer attend better to the character center points, and the recognition loss propagation to the detector module enhances the localization of the character regions. Also, a strengthened sharing stage allows feature rectification and boundary localization of arbitrary-shaped text regions.

		"abstract": "Learning discriminative powerful representations is a crucial step for machine learning systems. Introducing invariance against arbitrary nuisance or sensitive attributes while performing well on specific tasks is an important problem in representation learning. This is mostly approached by purging the sensitive information from learned representations. In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement approach to invariant representation problem. We disentangle the meaningful and sensitive representations by enforcing orthogonality constraints as a proxy for independence. We explicitly enforce the meaningful representation to be agnostic to sensitive information by entropy maximization. The proposed approach is evaluated on five publicly available datasets and compared with state of the art methods for learning fairness and invariance achieving the state of the art performance on three datasets and comparable performance on the rest. Further, we perform an ablative study to evaluate the effect of each component.",

Additionally, superpixel-based pseudo-labels are generated to provide supervision; (2) An adaptive local prototype pooling module plugged into prototypical networks, to solve the common challenging foreground-background imbalance problem in medical image segmentation; (3) We demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed approach for medical images using three different tasks: abdominal organ segmentation for CT and MRI, as well as cardiac segmentation for MRI.

		"abstract": "Land cover classification of satellite imagery is an important step toward analyzing the Earth's surface. Existing models assume a closed-set setting where both the training and testing classes belong to the same label set. However, due to the unique characteristics of satellite imagery with an extremely vast area of versatile cover materials, the training data are bound to be non-representative. In this paper, we study the problem of open-set land cover classification that identifies the samples belonging to unknown classes during testing, while maintaining performance on known classes. Although inherently a classification problem, both representative and discriminative aspects of data need to be exploited in order to better distinguish unknown classes from known. We propose a representative-discriminative open-set recognition (RDOSR) framework, which 1) projects data from the raw image space to the embedding feature space that facilitates differentiating similar classes, and further 2) enhances both the representative and discriminative capacity through transformation to a so-called abundance space. Experiments on multiple satellite benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also show the generality of the proposed approach by achieving promising results on open-set classification tasks using RGB images.",

Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) could leverage structure information to learn structure representations. However, adopting GCNs to tackle such continuous action sequences both in spatial and temporal space is challenging as the action graph could be huge. To overcome this challenge, we propose a variant of GCNs to leverage the self-attention mechanism to prune a complete action graph in the temporal space. Our method could dynamically attend to past important frames and construct a sparse graph to apply in the GCN framework, well capturing the structure information in action sequences.

There are two popular approaches that do not require annotated depth maps:(i) using labelled synthetic and unlabeled real data in an adversarial framework to predict more accurate depth, and (ii) unsupervised models which exploit geometric structure across space and time in monocular video frames. Ideally, we would like to leverage features provided by both approaches as they complement each other; however, existing methods do not adequately exploit these additive benefits.

		"title": "PieNet: Personalized Image Enhancement Network",
		"abstract": "Image enhancement is an inherently subjective process since people have diverse preferences for image aesthetics. However, most enhancement techniques pay less attention to the personalization issue despite its importance. In this paper, we propose the first deep learning approach to personalized image enhancement, which can enhance new images for a new user, by asking him or her to select about 10$\\sim$20 preferred images from a random set of images. First, we represent various users' preferences for enhancement as feature vectors in an embedding space, called preference vectors. We construct the embedding space based on metric learning. Then, we develop the personalized image enhancement network (PieNet) to enhance images adaptively using each user's preference vector. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving personalization successfully, as well as outperforming conventional general image enhancement algorithms significantly.

		"title": "Rotational Outlier Identification in Pose Graphs Using Dual Decomposition",
		"abstract": "In the last few years, there has been an increasing trend to consider Structure from Motion (SfM, in computer vision) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM, in robotics) problems from the point of view of pose averaging (also known as global SfM, in computer vision) or Pose Graph Optimization (PGO, in robotics), where the motion of the camera is reconstructed by considering only relative rigid body transformations instead of including also 3-D points (as done in a full Bundle Adjustment). At a high level, the advantage of this approach is that modern solvers can effectively avoid most of the problems of local minima, and that it is easier to reason about outlier poses (caused by feature mismatches and repetitive structures in the images). In this paper, we contribute to the state of the art of the latter, by proposing a method to detect incorrect orientation measurements prior to pose graph optimization by checking the geometric consistency of rotation measurements. The novel aspects of our method are the use of Expectation-Maximization to fine-tune the covariance of the noise in inlier measurements, and a new approximate graph inference procedure, of independent interest, that is specifically designed to take advantage of evidence on cycles with better performance than standard approaches (Belief Propagation). The paper includes simulation and experimental results that evaluate the performance of our outlier detection and cycle-based inference algorithms on synthetic and real-world data.",

		"abstract": "Speech-driven facial animation methods should produce accurate and realistic lip motions with natural expressions and realistic texture portraying target-specific facial characteristics. Moreover, the methods should also be adaptable to any unknown faces and speech quickly during inference. Current state-of-the-art methods fail to generate realistic animation from any speech on unknown faces due to their poor gen-eralization over different facial characteristics, languages, and accents. Some of these failures can be attributed to the end-to-end learning of the complex relationship between the multiple modalities of speech and the video. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy where we partition the problem and learn the motion and texture separately. Firstly, we train a GAN network to learn the lip motion in a canonical landmark using DeepSpeech features and induce eye-blinks before transferring the motion to the person-specific face. Next, we use another GAN based texture generator network to generate high fidelity face corresponding to the motion on person-specific landmark. We use meta-learning to make the texture generator GAN more flexible to adapt to the unknown subject’s traits of the face during inference. Our method gives significantly improved facial animation than the state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well across the different datasets, different languages, and accents,and also works reliably well in presence of noises in the speech.",

Conventional methods solve this problem via iterative (alternating) minimization by leveraging some prior knowledge about the structure of the unknown image. The inherent ambiguities about shift and flip in the Fourier measurements make this problem especially difficult; and most of the existing methods use several random restarts with different permutations. In this paper, we assume that a known (learned) reference is added to the signal before capturing the Fourier amplitude measurements. Our method is inspired by the principle of adding a reference signal in holography. To recover the signal, we implement an iterative phase retrieval method as an unrolled network. Then we use back propagation to learn the reference that provides us the best reconstruction for a fixed number of phase retrieval iterations. We performed a number of simulations on a variety of datasets under different conditions and found that our proposed method for phase retrieval via unrolled network and learned reference provides near-perfect recovery at fixed (small) computational cost. We compared our method with standard Fourier phase retrieval methods and observed significant performance enhancement using the learned reference.",

Here, we consider a setting closely mimicking the real-world scenario, where the unlabeled data are collected from unconstrained environment and their identities are exclusive from the labeled ones. Our main insight is that although the class information is not available, we can still faithfully approximate these semantic relationship by constructing a relational graph in a bottom-up manner. We propose Consensus-Driven Propagation (CDP) to tackle this challenging problem with two well-designed modules, the \"committee\" and the \"mediator\", which select positive face pairs robustly by carefully aggregating multi-view information. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of both modules to discard outliers and mine hard positives.

Sparsity results in efficiency while well connectedness can preserve the expressive power of the CNNs. We use a well-studied class of graphs from theoretical computer science that satisfies these properties known as Expander graphs. Expander graphs are used to model connections between filters in CNNs to design networks called X-Nets. We present two guarantees on the connectivity of X-Nets: Each node influences every node in a layer in logarithmic steps, and the number of paths between two sets of nodes is proportional to the product of their sizes. We also propose efficient training and inference algorithms, making it possible to train deeper and wider X-Nets effectively. Expander based models give a 4% improvement in accuracy on MobileNet over grouped convolutions, a popular technique, which has the same sparsity but worse connectivity.

It learns to attend to lower-level feature activations without requiring part annotations and uses these activations to update and rectify the output likelihood distribution. In contrast to other approaches, the proposed mechanism is modular, architecture-independent and efficient both in terms of parameters and computation required. Experiments show that networks augmented with our approach systematically improve their classification accuracy and become more robust to clutter. As a result, Wide Residual Networks augmented with our proposal surpasses the state of the art classification accuracies in CIFAR-10, the Adience gender recognition task, Stanford dogs, and UEC Food-100.",

		"title": "PyramidBox: A Context-assisted Single Shot Face Detector",
		"abstract": "Face detection has been well studied for many years and one of remaining challenges is to detect small, blurred and partially occluded faces in uncontrolled environment. This paper proposes a novel context-assisted single shot face detector, named emph{PyramidBox} to handle the hard face detection problem. Observing the importance of the context, we improve the utilization of contextual information in the following three aspects. First, we design a novel context anchor to supervise high-level contextual feature learning by a semi-supervised method, which we call it PyramidAnchors. Second, we propose the Low-level Feature Pyramid Network to combine adequate high-level context semantic feature and Low-level facial feature together, which also allows the PyramidBox to predict faces of all scales in a single shot. Third, we introduce a context-sensitive structure to increase the capacity of prediction network to improve the final accuracy of output. In addition, we use the method of Data-anchor-sampling to augment the training samples across different scales, which increases the diversity of training data for smaller faces. By exploiting the value of context, PyramidBox achieves superior performance among the state-of-the-art over the two common face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER FACE.

Large camera-to-subject distances and high variations in head pose and eye gaze angles are common in such environments. This leads to two main shortfalls in state-of-the-art methods for gaze estimation: hindered ground truth gaze annotation and diminished gaze estimation accuracy as image resolution decreases with distance. We first record a novel dataset of varied gaze and head pose images in a natural environment, addressing the issue of ground truth annotation by measuring head pose using a motion capture system and eye gaze using mobile eyetracking glasses. We apply semantic image inpainting to the area covered by the glasses to bridge the gap between training and testing images by removing the obtrusiveness of the glasses. We also present a new real-time algorithm involving appearance-based deep convolutional neural networks with increased capacity to cope with the diverse images in the new dataset. Experiments with this network architecture are conducted on a number of diverse eye-gaze datasets including our own, and in cross dataset evaluations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of estimation accuracy in all experiments, and the architecture performs well even on lower resolution images.",

To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach named Highly-economized Scalable Image Clustering (HSIC) that radically surpasses conventional image clustering methods via binary compression. We intuitively unify the binary representation learning and efficient binary cluster structure learning into a joint framework. In particular, common binary representations are learned by exploiting both sharable and individual information across multiple views in order to capture their underlying correlations. Meanwhile, cluster assignment with robust binary centroids is also performed via effective discrete optimization under L21-norm constraint. By this means, heavy continuous-valued Euclidean distance computations can be successfully reduced by efficient binary XOR operations during the clustering procedure. To our best knowledge, HSIC is the first binary clustering work specifically designed for scalable multi-view image clustering. Extensive experimental results on four large-scale image datasets show that HSIC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, whilst significantly reducing computational time and memory footprint.",

This strategy can provide more accurate and consistent temporal information, which produces higher quality restoration. In addition, the strong prior information of the prediction residual is also exploited for restoration through a well designed neural network. These two components are combined under the Kalman framework and optimized through the deep Kalman filtering network.

Traditionally, deep regression employ the L2 loss function, known to be sensitive to outliers, i.e. samples that either lie at an abnormal distance away from the majority of the training samples, or that correspond to wrongly annotated targets. This means that, during back-propagation, outliers may bias the training process due to the high magnitude of their gradient. In this paper, we propose DeepGUM: a deep regression model that is robust to outliers thanks to the use of a Gaussian-uniform mixture model. We derive an optimization algorithm that alternates between the unsupervised detection of outliers using expectation-maximization, and the supervised training with cleaned samples using stochastic gradient descent. DeepGUM is able to adapt to a continuously evolving outlier distribution, avoiding to manually impose any threshold on the proportion of outliers in the training set. Extensive experimental evaluations on four different tasks (facial and fashion landmark detection, age and head pose estimation) lead us to conclude that our novel robust technique provides reliability in the presence of various types of noise and protection against a high percentage of outliers.",

Specifically, we first separately adopt two metric networks, following two deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to learn modality-specific discriminative features based on an importance-aware metric learning method. Subsequently, we explicitly introduce a cross-modality transformation network to compensate for the divergence between two modalities, which can transfer features of 2D sketches to the feature space of 3D shapes. We develop an adversarial learning based method to train the transformation model, by simultaneously enhancing the holistic correlations between data distributions of two modalities, and mitigating the local semantic divergences through minimizing a cross-modality mean discrepancy term.

Another line of work has shown that matrix power normalization after aggregation can significantly improve the generalization of second-order representations. We show that matrix power normalization implicitly equalizes contributions during aggregation thus establishing a connection between matrix normalization techniques and prior work on minimizing interference. Based on the analysis we present $gamma$-democratic aggregators that interpolate between sum ($gamma$=1) and democratic pooling ($gamma$=0) outperforming both on several classification tasks.

Thus, the semantic meaning of the input image cannot be comprehensively understood, which restricts improving the performance.

At inference time, our phrase-critic model takes an image and a candidate explanation as input and outputs a score indicating how well the candidate explanation is grounded in the image. Our explainable AI agent is capable of providing counter arguments for an alternative prediction, i.e. counterfactuals, along with explanations that justify the correct classification decisions.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a CNN-based object detection architecture, referred to as a parallel feature pyramid (FP) network (PFPNet), where the FP is constructed by widening the network width instead of increasing the network depth. First, we adopt spatial pyramid pooling and some additional feature transformations to generate a pool of feature maps with different sizes. In PFPNet, the additional feature transformation is performed in parallel, which yields the feature maps with similar levels of semantic abstraction across the scales. We then resize the elements of the feature pool to a uniform size and aggregate their contextual information to generate each level of the final FP.

In this setting, domain adaptation brings an appealing option. The effective approaches of domain adaptation shape the representations that (1) are discriminative for the main task and (2) have good generalization capability for domain shift. To this end, we propose a novel loss function, i.e., Conservative Loss, which penalizes the extreme good and bad cases while encouraging the moderate examples. More specifically, it enables the network to learn features that are discriminative by gradient descent and are invariant to the change of domains via gradient ascend method. Extensive experiments on synthetic to real segmentation adaptation show our proposed method achieves state of the art results. Ablation studies give more insights into properties of the Conservative Loss. Additional exploratory experiments and discussion demonstrate that our Conservative Loss has good scalability rather than restricting an exact form.",

We apply the switchable TPN to three tasks: colorizing a gray-scale video based on a few colored key-frames, generating an HDR video from a low dynamic range (LDR) video and a few HDR frames, and propagating a segmentation mask from the first frame in videos.

The search process explores the space of exact parameters (i.e the entries of DIAC or PaI), benefits from the solution of a local method, and converges to the solution satisfied by the largest number of polynomials. Given many polynomials on the sought parameters (with possibly overwhelmingly many from outlier measurements), their consensus for calibration is searched for two cases: simplified Kruppa's equations and Modulus constraints, expressed in DIAC and PaI, resp.

		"abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of photometric stereo for non-Lambertian surfaces. Existing approaches often adopt simplified reflectance models to make the problem more tractable, but this greatly hinders their applications on real-world objects. In this paper, we propose a deep fully convolutional network, called PS-FCN, that takes an arbitrary number of images of a static object captured under different light directions with a fixed camera as input, and predicts a normal map of the object in a fast feed-forward pass. Unlike the recently proposed learning based method, PS-FCN does not require a pre-defined set of light directions during training and testing, and can handle multiple images and light directions in an order-agnostic manner. Although we train PS-FCN on synthetic data, it can generalize well on real datasets. We further show that PS-FCN can be easily extended to handle the problem of uncalibrated photometric stereo. Extensive experiments on public real datasets show that PS-FCN outperforms existing approaches in calibrated photometric stereo, and promising results are achieved in uncalibrated scenario, clearly demonstrating its effectiveness.",

		"title": "Instance-level Human Parsing via Part Grouping Network",
		"abstract": "Instance-level human parsing towards real-world human analysis scenarios is still under-explored due to the absence of sufficient data resources and technical difficulty in parsing multiple instances in a single pass. Several related works all follow the ``parsing-by-detection\" pipeline that heavily relies on separately trained detection models to localize instances and then performs human parsing for each instance sequentially. Nonetheless, two discrepant optimization targets of detection and parsing lead to suboptimal representation learning and error accumulation for final results. In this work, we make the first attempt to explore a detection-free Part Grouping Network (PGN) for efficiently parsing multiple people in an image in a single pass. Our PGN reformulates instance-level human parsing as two twinned sub-tasks that can be jointly learned and mutually refined via a unified network: 1) semantic part segmentation for assigning each pixel as a human part (e.g., face, arms); 2) instance-aware edge detection to group semantic parts into distinct person instances. Thus the shared intermediate representation would be endowed with capabilities in both characterizing fine-grained parts and inferring instance belongings of each part. Finally, a simple instance partition process is employed to get final results during inference. We conducted experiments on PASCAL-Person-Part dataset and our PGN outperforms all state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show its superiority on a newly collected multi-person parsing dataset (CIHP) including 38,280 diverse images, which is the largest dataset so far and can facilitate more advanced human analysis.",

		"title": "Normalized Blind Deconvolution",
		"abstract": "We introduce a family of novel approaches to single-image blind deconvolution, ie , the problem of recovering a sharp image and a blur kernel from a single blurry input. This problem is highly ill-posed, because infinite (image, blur) pairs produce the same blurry image. Most research effort has been devoted to the design of priors for natural images and blur kernels, which can drastically prune the set of possible solutions. Unfortunately, these priors are usually not sufficient to favor the sharp solution. In this paper we address this issue by looking at a much less studied aspect: the relative scale ambiguity between the sharp image and the blur. Most prior work eliminates this ambiguity by fixing the $L^1$ norm of the blur kernel. In principle, however, this choice is arbitrary. We show that a careful design of the blur normalization yields a blind deconvolution formulation with remarkable accuracy and robustness to noise. Specifically, we show that using the Frobenius norm to fix the scale ambiguity enables convex image priors, such as the total variation, to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets.",

The singular value decomposition of the network weight is computed, then a binary masking variable is introduced to denote whether a particular singular value and the corresponding singular vectors are used in low-rank approximation.

A recent study shows that kernel matrix works considerably better than covariance matrix for this kind of representation, by modeling the higher-order, nonlinear relationship among pooled visual descriptors. Nevertheless, in that study neither the descriptors nor the kernel matrix is deeply learned. Worse, they are considered separately, hindering the pursuit of an optimal representation. To improve this situation, this work designs a deep network that jointly learns local descriptors and kernel-matrix-based pooled representation in an end-to-end manner. The derivatives for the mapping from a local descriptor set to this representation are derived to carry out backpropagation. More importantly, we introduce the {Daleckiv{i}-Krev{i}n formula} from Operator theory to give a concise and unified result on differentiating general functions defined on symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrix, which shows its better numerical stability in conducting backpropagation compared with the existing method when handling the Riemannian geometry of SPD matrix.

Based on the complementary characteristics of these two methods, we propose a novel Complementary Temporal Action Proposal (CTAP) generator. Specifically, we apply a Proposal-level Actionness Trustworthiness Estimator (PATE) on the sliding windows proposals to generate the probabilities indicating whether the actions can be correctly detected by actionness scores, the windows with high scores are collected.

		"title": "Neural Network Encapsulation",
		"abstract": "A capsule is a collection of neurons which represents different variants of a pattern in the network. The routing scheme ensures only certain capsules who resemble lower counterparts in the higher layer should be activated. However, the computational complexity becomes an bottleneck for scaling up to larger networks, as lower capsules need to correspond to each and every higher capsule. To resolve this limitation, we approximate the routing process with two branches: a master branch which collects primary information from its direct contact in the lower layer and an aide branch that replenishes master based on pattern variants encoded in other lower capsules. Compared with previous iterative and unsupervised routing scheme, these two branches are communicated in a fast, supervised and one-time pass fashion. The complexity and runtime of the model are therefore decreased by a large margin. Motivated by the routing to make higher capsule have agreement with lower capsule, we extend the mechanism as a compensation for the rapid loss of information in nearby layers. We devise a feedback agreement unit to send back higher capsules as feedback. It could be regarded as an additional regularization to the network. The feedback agreement is achieved by comparing the optimal transport divergence between two distributions. Such an add-on witnesses a unanimous gain in both capsule and vanilla networks. Our proposed EncapNet performs favorably better against previous state-of-the-arts on CIFAR10/100, SVHN and a subset of ImageNet which consists of 200 hardest object classes.",

		"title": "Retrospective Encoders for Video Summarization",

State-of-the-art approaches mostly regard the predicted summary and the human summary as two sequences (sets), and minimize discriminative losses that measure element-wise discrepancy. Such training objectives do not explicitly model how well the predicted summary preserves semantic information in the video. Moreover, those methods often demand a large amount of human generated summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence learning model to address these deficiencies. The key idea is to complement the discriminative losses with another loss which measures if the predicted summary preserves the same information as in the original video. To this end, we propose to augment standard sequence learning models with an additional ``retrospective encoder'' that embeds the predicted summary into an abstract semantic space. The embedding is then compared to the embedding of the original video in the same space. The intuition is that both embeddings ought to be close to each other for a video and its corresponding summary. Thus our approach adds to the discriminative loss a metric learning loss that minimizes the distance between such pairs while maximizing the distances between unmatched ones. One important advantage is that the metric learning loss readily allows learning from videos without human generated summaries. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms existing ones by a large margin in both supervised and semi-supervised settings.",

As these distributions are conditioned on the observed image, the network can learn which scene and object types are likely to violate the model assumptions, resulting in more robust learning. We also propose to build on dozens of years of experience in developing handcrafted structure-from-motion (SFM) algorithms. We do so by using an off-the-shelf SFM system to generate a supervisory signal for the deep neural network. While this signal is also noisy, we show that our probabilistic formulation can learn and account for the defects of SFM, helping to integrate different sources of information and boosting the overall performance of the network.",

Moreover, there exist input-agnostic noise, called Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) that can affect inference of the models over most input samples. Given a model, there exist broadly two approaches to craft UAPs: (i) data-driven: that require data, and (ii) data-free: that do not require data samples. Data-driven approaches require actual samples from the underlying data distribution and craft UAPs with high success (fooling) rate. However, data-free approaches craft UAPs without utilizing any data samples and therefore result in lesser success rates. In this paper, for data-free scenarios, we propose a novel approach that emulates the effect of data samples with class impressions in order to craft UAPs using data-driven objectives. Class impression for a given pair of category and model is a generic representation (in the input space) of the samples belonging to that category. Further, we present a neural network based generative model that utilizes the acquired class impressions to learn crafting UAPs. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the learned generative model, (i) readily crafts UAPs via simple feed-forwarding through neural network layers, and (ii) achieves state-of-the-art success rates for data-free scenario and closer to that for data-driven setting without actually utilizing any data samples.",

In this work, we suggest a theoretically inspired novel approach to improve the networks' robustness. Our method applies regularization using the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian of the network, which is applied as post-processing, after regular training has finished. We demonstrate empirically that it leads to enhanced robustness results with a minimal change in the original network's accuracy.",

		"title": "Recurrent Tubelet Proposal and Recognition Networks for Action Detection",
		"abstract": "Detecting actions in videos is a challenging task as video is an information intensive media with complex variations. Existing approaches predominantly generate action proposals for each individual frame or fixed-length clip independently, while overlooking temporal context across them. Such temporal contextual relations are vital for action detection as an action is by nature a sequence of movements. This motivates us to leverage the localized action proposals in previous frames when determining action regions in the current one. Specifically, we present a novel deep architecture called Recurrent Tubelet Proposal and Recognition (RTPR) networks to incorporate temporal context for action detection. The proposed RTPR consists of two correlated networks, i.e., Recurrent Tubelet Proposal (RTP) networks and Recurrent Tubelet Recognition (RTR) networks. The RTP initializes action proposals of the start frame through a Region Proposal Network and then estimates the movements of proposals in next frame in a recurrent manner. The action proposals of different frames are linked to form the tubelet proposals. The RTR capitalizes on a multi-channel architecture, where in each channel, a tubelet proposal is fed into a CNN plus LSTM to recurrently recognize action in the tubelet. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate superior results over state-of-the-art methods. More remarkably, we obtain mAP of 98.6%, 81.3%, 77.9% and 22.3% with gains of 2.9%, 4.3%, 0.7% and 3.9% over the best competitors on UCF-Sports, J-HMDB, UCF-101 and AVA, respectively.",

An extra set of logic gates is added to update the input given the output. Stacking multiple such layers results in a recurrent auto-encoder: the operators updating the outputs comprise the encoder, while the ones updating the inputs form the decoder. Since the states are shared between corresponding encoder and decoder layers, the representation is stratified during learning: some information is not passed to the next layers. We test our model on future video prediction. Main challenges for this task include high variability in videos, temporal propagation of errors, and non-specificity of future frames. We show how only the encoder or decoder needs to be applied for encoding or prediction. This reduces the computational cost and avoids re-encoding predictions when generating multiple frames, mitigating error propagation. Furthermore, it is possible to remove layers from a trained model, giving an insight to the role of each layer.

Specifically, we introduce a Holistic Scene Grammar (HSG) to represent the 3D scene structure, which characterizes a joint distribution over the functional and geometric space of indoor scenes. The proposed HSG captures three essential and often latent dimensions of the indoor scenes: i) latent human context, describing the affordance and the functionality of a room arrangement, ii) geometric constraints over the scene configurations, and iii) physical constraints that guarantee physically plausible parsing and reconstruction. We solve this joint parsing and reconstruction problem in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion, seeking to minimize the differences between the input image and the rendered images generated by our 3D representation, over the space of depth, surface normal, and object segmentation map. The optimal configuration, represented by a parse graph, is inferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which efficiently traverses through the non-differentiable solution space, jointly optimizing object localization, 3D layout, and hidden human context. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the generalization ability and significantly outperforms prior methods on 3D layout estimation, 3D object detection, and holistic scene understanding.",

Moreover, the importance of each factor may vary for different object categories and image content, making it difficult to manually define the matching criteria. In this paper, we propose to learn feature representations for foreground objects and background scenes respectively, where image content and object category information are jointly encoded during training. As a result, the learned features can adaptively encode the most important compatibility factors. We project the features to a common embedding space, so that the compatibility scores can be easily measured using the cosine similarity, enabling very efficient search.

So far, however, these initial matching approaches are rather general: They do not incorporate any additional information that could help to improve the accuracy or the robustness of the estimation. In particular, they do not exploit potential cues on the camera poses and the thereby induced rigid motion of the scene. In the present paper, we tackle this problem. To this end, we propose a novel structure-from-motion-aware PatchMatch approach that, in contrast to existing matching techniques, combines two hierarchical feature matching methods: a recent two-frame PatchMatch approach for optical flow estimation (general motion) and a specifically tailored three-frame PatchMatch approach for rigid scene reconstruction (SfM). While the motion PatchMatch serves as baseline with good accuracy, the SfM counterpart takes over at occlusions and other regions with insufficient information. Experiments with our novel SfM-aware PatchMatch approach demonstrate its usefulness. They not only show excellent results for all major benchmarks (KITTI 2012/2015, MPI Sintel), but also improvements up to 50 percent compared to a PatchMatch approach without structure information.",

The attention network predicts spatial attention maps of images, and the transformation network focuses on translating objects. Attention maps produced by attention network are encouraged to be sparse, so that major attention can be paid on objects of interests.

A key insight of this paper is that the network achieves a sub-pixel matching precision than is a magnitude higher than those of traditional stereo matching approaches. This allows us to achieve real-time performance by using a very low resolution cost volume that encodes all the information needed to achieve high depth precision. Spatial precision is achieved by employing a learned edge-aware upsampling function. Our model uses a Siamese network to extract features from the left and right image. A first estimate of the disparity is computed in a very low resolution cost volume, then hierarchically the model re-introduces high-frequency details through a learned upsampling function that uses compact pixel-to-pixel refinement networks. Leveraging color input as a guide, this function is capable of producing high-quality edge-aware output.

Here, we observe that the most problematic failures of this approach occur when objects are cropped, omitted, or duplicated. We therefore take an object-centered approach to the problem, leveraging recent advances in object detection. We penalize candidate solutions with this class of error by modifying the energy function used in the seam finding stage. This produces substantially more realistic stitching results on challenging imagery.

The models, however, still perform far from being satisfactory when applied to real-world daily scenes. Based on our analyses, we rst identify 7 crucial aspects that a comprehensive and balanced dataset should fulll. Then, we propose a new high-quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark. Specically, our SOC (Salient Objects in Clutter) dataset, includes images with salient and non-salient objects from daily object categories. Beyond object category annotations, each salient image is accompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in real-world scenes.

		"abstract": "Unsupervised image-to-image translation is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. Given an image in the source domain, the goal is to learn the conditional distribution of corresponding images in the target domain, without seeing any pairs of corresponding images. While this conditional distribution is inherently multimodal, existing approaches make an overly simplified assumption, modeling it as a deterministic one-to-one mapping. As a result, they fail to generate diverse outputs from a given source domain image. To address this limitation, we propose a Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-image Translation (MUNIT) framework. We assume that the image representation can be decomposed into a content code that is domain-invariant, and a style code that captures domain-specific properties. To translate an image to another domain, we recombine its content code with a random style code sampled from the style space of the target domain. We analyze the proposed framework and establish several theoretical results. Extensive experiments with comparisons to the state-of-the-art approaches further demonstrates the advantage of the proposed framework. Moreover, our framework allows users to control the style of translation outputs by providing an example style image.",

Many previous studies aimed to visualize the selectivity of individual units by finding meaningful images that maximize their activation. However, comparably little attention has been paid to visualizing to what image transformations units in DNNs are invariant. Here we propose a method to discover invariances in the responses of hidden layer units of deep neural networks. Our approach is based on simultaneously searching for a batch of images that strongly activate a unit while at the same time being as distinct from each other as possible. We find that even early convolutional layers in VGG-19 exhibit various forms of response invariance: near-perfect phase invariance in some units and invariance to local diffeomorphic transformations in others. At the same time, we uncover representational differences with ResNet-50 in its corresponding layers. We conclude that invariance transformations are a major computational component learned by DNNs and we provide a systematic method to study them.",

Given an image as input, it requires the system to generate a caption that has a specific style (e.g., humorous, romantic, positive, and negative) while describing the image content semantically accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel stylized image captioning model that effectively takes both requirements into consideration. To this end, we first devise a new variant of LSTM, named style-factual LSTM, as the building block of our model. It uses two groups of matrices to capture the factual and stylized knowledge, respectively, and automatically learns the word-level weights of the two groups based on previous context. In addition, when we train the model to capture stylized elements, we propose an adaptive learning approach based on a reference factual model, it provides factual knowledge to the model as the model learns from stylized caption labels, and can adaptively compute how much information to supply at each time step. We evaluate our model on two stylized image captioning datasets, which contain humorous/romantic captions and positive/negative captions, respectively.

		"title": "Deblurring Natural Image Using Super-Gaussian Fields",
		"abstract": "Blind image deblurring is a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature, of which the success is closely related to a proper image prior. Although a large number of sparsity-based priors, such as the sparse gradient prior, have been successfully applied for blind image deblurring, they inherently suffer from several drawbacks, limiting their applications. Existing sparsity-based priors are usually rooted in modeling the response of images to some specific filters (e.g., image gradients), which are insufficient to capture the complicated image structures. Moreover, the traditional sparse priors or regularizations model the filter response (e.g., image gradients) independently and thus fail to depict the long range correlation among them. To address the above issues, we present a novel image prior for image deblurring based on a Super-Gaussian field model with adaptive structures. Instead of modeling the response of the fixed short-term filters, the proposed Super-Gaussian fields capture the complicated structures in natural images by integrating potentials on all cliques (e.g., centring at each pixel) into a joint probabilistic distribution. Considering that the fixed filters in different scales are impractical for the coarse-to-fine framework of image deblurring, we define each potential function as a super-Gaussian distribution. Through this definition, the partition function, the curse for traditional MRFs, can be theoretically ignored, and all model parameters of the proposed Super-Gaussian fields can be data-adaptively learned and inferred from the blurred observation with a variational framework. Extensive experiments on both blind deblurring and non-blind deblurring demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

		"abstract": "Many previous literatures use landmarks to guide the cor- respondence of 3D faces. However, these landmarks, either manually or automatically annotated, are hard to define consistently across differ- ent faces in many circumstances. We propose a general framework for dense correspondence of 3D faces without landmarks in this paper. The dense correspondence goal is revisited in two perspectives: semantic and topological correspondence. Starting from a template facial mesh, we sequentially perform global alignment, primary correspondence by tem- plate warping, and contextual mesh refinement, to reach the final cor- respondence result. The semantic correspondence is achieved by a local iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm of kernelized version, allowing accurate matching of local features. Then, robust deformation from the template to the target face is formulated as a minimization problem. Fur- thermore, this problem leads to a well-posed sparse linear system such that the solution is unique and efficient. Finally, a contextual mesh re- fining algorithm is applied to ensure topological correspondence. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively on two datasets including a publicly available FRGC v2.0 dataset, demonstrating reasonable and reliable correspondence results.",

However, it is largely overlooked in semantic segmentation currently dominated by methods mimicking full supervision via ``fake'' fully-labeled masks (proposals) generated from available partial input. To obtain such full masks the typical methods explicitly use standard regularization techniques for ``shallow'' segmentation, e.g. graph cuts or dense CRFs. In contrast, we integrate such standard regularizers directly into the loss functions over partial input. This approach simplifies weakly-supervised training by avoiding extra MRF/CRF inference steps or layers explicitly generating full masks, while improving both the quality and efficiency of training.

		"title": "Learning Dynamic Memory Networks for Object Tracking",
		"abstract": "Template-matching methods for visual tracking have gained popularity recently due to their comparable performance and fast speed. However, they lack effective ways to adapt to changes in the target object’s appearance, making their tracking accuracy still far from state-of-the-art. In this paper, we propose a dynamic memory network to adapt the template to the target’s appearance variations during tracking. An LSTM is used as a memory controller, where the input is the search feature map and the outputs are the control signals for the reading and writing process of the memory block. As the location of the target is at first unknown in the search feature map, an attention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential target. To prevent aggressive model adaptivity, we apply gated residual template learning to control the amount of retrieved memory that is used to combine with the initial template. Unlike tracking-by-detection methods where the object’s information is maintained by the weight parameters of neural networks, which requires expensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our tracker runs completely feed-forward and adapts to the target’s appearance changes by updating the external memory. Moreover, unlike other tracking methods where the model capacity is fixed after offline training – the capacity of our tracker can be easily enlarged as the memory require- ments of a task increase, which is favorable for memorizing long-term ob- ject information. Extensive experiments on OTB and VOT demonstrates that our tracker MemTrack performs favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods while retaining real-time speed of 50 fps.",

		"abstract": "Domain adaptation is an important tool to transfer knowledge about a task (e.g. classification) learned in a source domain to a second, or target domain. Current approaches assume that task-relevant target-domain data is available during training. We demonstrate how to perform domain adaptation when no such task-relevant target-domain data is available. To tackle this issue, we propose zero-shot deep domain adaptation (ZDDA), which uses privileged information from task-irrelevant dual-domain pairs. ZDDA learns a source-domain representation which is not only tailored for the task of interest but also close to the target-domain representation. Therefore, the source-domain task of interest solution (e.g. a classifier for classification tasks) which is jointly trained with the source-domain representation can be applicable to both the source and target representations. Using the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, NIST, EMNIST, and SUN RGB-D datasets, we show that ZDDA can perform domain adaptation in classification tasks without access to task-relevant target-domain training data. We also extend ZDDA to perform sensor fusion in the SUN RGB-D scene classification task by simulating task-relevant target-domain representations with task-relevant source-domain data. To the best of our knowledge, ZDDA is the first domain adaptation and sensor fusion method which requires no task-relevant target-domain data.

We observe that the imbalanced distribution of training data makes the learned features less discriminative. During the off-line training phase, an effective sampling strategy is introduced to control this distribution and make the model focus on the semantic distractors. During inference, a novel distractor-aware module is designed to perform incremental learning, which can effectively transfer the general embedding to the current video domain.

For the first time we compare several strategies and techniques to estimate uncertainty in a large-scale computer vision task like optical flow estimation. Moreover, we introduce a new network architecture and loss function that enforce complementary hypotheses and provide uncertainty estimates efficiently with a single forward pass and without the need for sampling or ensembles.

We decompose the procedure of image-to-image translation task into three iterated steps, first is to generate an image with global structure but some local artifacts (via GAN), second is using our DRPnet to propose the most fake region from the generated image, and third is to implement \"image inpainting\" on the most fake region for more realistic result through a reviser, so that the system (DRPAN) can be gradually optimized to synthesize images with more attention on the most artifact local part.

Nevertheless, a video sequence could also contain a lot of redundant and irrelevant frames. How to locate critical information of interest is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new network structure, known as Redundancy Reduction Attention (RRA), which learns to focus on multiple discriminative patterns by suppressing redundant feature channels. Specifically, it firstly summarizes the video by weight-summing all feature vectors in the feature maps of selected frames with a spatio-temporal soft attention, and then predicts which channels to suppress or to enhance according to this summary with a learned non-linear transform. Suppression is achieved by modulating the feature maps and threshing out weak activations. The updated feature maps are then used in the next iteration. Finally, the video is classified based on multiple summaries. The proposed method achieves outstanding performances in multiple video classification datasets.

Previous studies showed that low-resolution color and high-resolution grayscale images preserve saliency information. However, to our knowledge, no one has investigated whether saliency is preserved in low-resolution grayscale (LG) images.

Differing from the traditional three-view geometry, we show that this constraint directly encodes camera rotation and projection, and is independent of camera translation. In theory, six polarized diffusive point-point-point correspondences suffice to determine the camera rotations. In practise, a cross-validation mechanism using correspondences of specularites can effectively resolve the ambiguities caused by mixed polarization.

With that in mind, we propose an effective method that extracts and aggregates visual attention masks at different scales. We introduce a loss function to handle class imbalance both at class and at an instance level and further demonstrate that penalizing attention masks with high prediction variance accounts for the weak supervision of the attention mechanism.

We propose adding a simple yet effective Element-wise-Attention Gate (EleAttG) to an RNN block (e.g., all RNN neurons in a network layer) that empowers the RNN neurons to have the attentiveness capability. For an RNN block, an EleAttG is added to adaptively modulate the input by assigning different levels of importance, i.e., attention, to each element/dimension of the input. We refer to an RNN block equipped with an EleAttG as an EleAtt-RNN block. Specically, the modulation of the input is content adaptive and is performed at ne granularity, being element-wise rather than input-wise. The proposed EleAttG, as an additional fundamental unit, is general and can be applied to any RNN structures, e.g., standard RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EleAtt-RNN by applying it to the action recognition tasks on both 3D human skeleton data and RGB videos.

Traditional methods often impose certain priors or assumptions to target particular type(s) of reflection such as shifted double reflection, thus have difficulty to generalise to other types. Very recently a deep learning approach has been proposed. It learns a deep neural network that directly maps a reflection contaminated image to a background (target) image (ie reflection free image) in an end to end fashion, and outperforms the previous methods. We argue that, to remove reflection truly well, we should estimate the reflection and utilise it to estimate the background image. We propose a cascade deep neural network, which estimates both the background image and the reflection. This significantly improves reflection removal. In the cascade deep network, we use the estimated background image to estimate the reflection, and then use the estimated reflection to estimate the background image, facilitating our idea of seeing deeply and bidirectionally.",

This paper introduces partial domain adaptation as a new domain adaptation scenario, which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption to that the source label space subsumes the target label space. Previous methods typically match the whole source domain to the target domain, which are vulnerable to negative transfer for the partial domain adaptation problem due to the large mismatch between label spaces. We present Partial Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PADA), which simultaneously alleviates negative transfer by down-weighing the data of outlier source classes for training both source classifier and domain adversary, and promotes positive transfer by matching the feature distributions in the shared label space.

		"abstract": "Due to the succinct nature of free-hand sketch drawings, sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) has abundant practical use cases in consumer electronics. However, SBIR remains a long-standing unsolved problem mainly due to the significant discrepancy between the sketch domain and the image domain. In this work, we propose a Generative Domain-migration Hashing (GDH) approach, which for the first time generates hashing codes from synthetic natural images that are migrated from sketches. The generative model learns a mapping that the distributions of sketches can be indistinguishable from the distribution of natural images using an adversarial loss, and simultaneously learns an inverse mapping based on the cycle consistency loss in order to enhance the indistinguishability. With the robust mapping learned from the generative model, GDH can migrate sketches to their indistinguishable image counterparts while preserving the domain-invariant information of sketches. With an end-to-end multi-task learning framework, the generative model and binarized hashing codes can be jointly optimized. Comprehensive experiments of both category-level and fine-grained SBIR on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate the consistently balanced superiority of GDH in terms of efficiency, memory costs and effectiveness.",

The difficulties encountered by classical registration approaches include feature design and slow optimization by gradient descent. By analyzing these methods, we note the significance of the notion of scale. We design easy-to-train, fully-convolutional neural networks able to learn scale-specific features. Once chained appropriately, they perform global registration in linear time, getting rid of gradient descent schemes by predicting directly the deformation. We show their performance in terms of quality and speed through various tasks of remote sensing multimodal image alignment.

This paper tackles this problem by proposing FloorNet, a novel deep neural architecture. The challenge lies in the processing of RGBD streams spanning a large 3D space. FloorNet effectively processes the data through three neural network branches: 1) PointNet with 3D points, exploiting the 3D information; 2) CNN with a 2D point density image in a top-down view, enhancing the local spatial reasoning; and 3) CNN with RGB images, utilizing the full image information. FloorNet exchanges intermediate features across the branches to exploit the best of all the architectures. We have created a benchmark for floorplan reconstruction by acquiring RGBD video streams for 155 residential houses or apartments with Google Tango phones and annotating complete floorplan information. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the fusion of three branches effectively improves the reconstruction quality.

These examples can strongly influence parameters when the network is trained to correct them. Unfortunately, they are often sparse in the training data, and are expensive to obtain. In this work, we show how large numbers of hard negatives can be obtained {em automatically} by analyzing the output of a trained detector on video sequences. In particular, detections that are {em isolated in time}, i.e., that have no associated preceding or following detections, are likely to be hard negatives. We describe simple procedures for mining large numbers of such hard negatives (and also hard {em positives}) from unlabeled video data.

We evaluate several aspects of domain adaptation, including the impact of target domain size, the relative distance between source and target domain, and the initialization of conditional GANs. Our results show that using knowledge from pretrained networks can shorten the convergence time and can significantly improve the quality of the generated images, especially when the target data is limited.

		"abstract": "Due to the complementary benefits of visible (RGB) and thermal infrared (T) data, RGB-T object tracking attracts more and more attention recently for boosting the performance under adverse illumination conditions. Existing RGB-T tracking methods usually localize a target object with a bounding box, in which the trackers or detectors is often affected by the inclusion of background clutter. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel approach to suppress background effects for RGB-T tracking. Our approach relies on a novel cross-modal manifold ranking algorithm. First, we integrate the soft cross-modality consistency into the ranking model which allows the sparse inconsistency to account for the different properties between these two modalities. Second, we propose an optimal query learning method to handle label noises of queries. In particular, we introduce an intermediate variable to represent the optimal labels, and formulate it as a $l_1$-optimization based sparse learning problem. Moreover, we propose a single unified optimization algorithm to solve the proposed model with stable and efficient convergence behavior. Finally, the ranking results are incorporated into the patch-based object features to address the background effects, and the structured SVM is then adopted to perform RGB-T tracking. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed approach performs well against the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale benchmark datasets.",

Our core idea is that for rigid regions we can use the predicted scene depth and camera motion to synthesize 2D optical flow by backprojecting the induced 3D scene flow. The discrepancy between the rigid flow (from depth prediction and camera motion) and the estimated flow (from optical flow model) allows us to impose a cross-task consistency loss.

For example, one approach segments an object via optimizing its $k$-coverage by disjoint convex parts, which we show is highly sensitive to local minima. In contrast, our shape model allows the convex parts to overlap, which both relaxes and simplifies the coverage problem, e.g. fewer parts are needed to represent any object. As shown in the paper, for many forms of convexity our regularization model is significantly more descriptive for any given k. Our shape prior is useful in practice, e.g. in biomedical applications, and its optimization is robust to local minima.",

However, the objective of pre-training does not take the target task into account, and consequently such obtained models are suboptimal for fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new deep FGVC model termed MetaFGNet. Training of MetaFGNet is based on a novel regularized meta-learning objective, which aims to guide the learning of network parameters so that they are optimal for adapting to the target FGVC task. Based on MetaFGNet, we also propose a simple yet effective scheme for selecting more useful samples from the auxiliary data.

A CNN architecture with proper constraints and supervisions is proposed to overcome the problem of having no ground truth for the decomposition.

In this paper, we propose to overcome this problem by learning a geometry-aware body representation from multi-view images without annotations. To this end, we use an encoder-decoder that predicts an image from one viewpoint given an image from another viewpoint. Because this representation encodes 3D geometry, using it in a semi-supervised setting makes it easier to learn a mapping from it to 3D human pose.

		"abstract": "Anticipating future events is an important prerequisite towards intelligent behavior. Video forecasting has been studied as a proxy task towards this goal. Recent work has shown that to predict semantic segmentation of future frames, forecasting at the semantic level is more effective than forecasting RGB frames and then segmenting these. In this paper we consider the more challenging problem of future instance segmentation, which additionally segments out individual objects. To deal with a varying number of output labels per image, we develop a predictive model in the space of fixed-sized convolutional features of the Mask R-CNN instance segmentation model. We apply the \"detection head\" of Mask R-CNN on the predicted features to produce the instance segmentation of future frames. Experiments show that this approach significantly improves over strong baselines based on optical flow and repurposed instance segmentation architectures.",

Existing methods usually focus on improving the person detection accuracy to mitigate negative effects imposed by misalignment, mis-detections, and false alarms resulted from noisy people auto-detection. In contrast to previous studies, we show that sufficiently reliable person instance cropping is achievable by slightly improved state-of-the-art deep learning object detectors (e.g. Faster-RCNN), and the under-studied multi-scale matching problem in person search is a more severe barrier. In this work, we address this multi-scale person search challenge by proposing a Cross-Level Semantic Alignment (CLSA) deep learning approach capable of learning more discriminative identity feature representations in a unified end-to-end model. This is realised by exploiting the in-network feature pyramid structure of a deep neural network enhanced by a novel cross pyramid-level semantic alignment loss function. This favourably eliminates the need for constructing a computationally expensive image pyramid and a complex multi-branch network architecture. Extensive experiments show the modelling advantages and performance superiority of CLSA over the state-of-the-art person search and multi-scale matching methods on two large person search benchmarking datasets: CUHK-SYSU and PRW.",

In this work, we study the problem of generating consecutive multiple future frames by observing one single still image only. We formulate the multi-frame prediction task as a multiple time step flow (multi-flow) prediction phase followed by a flow-to-frame synthesis phase. The multi-flow prediction is modeled in a variational probabilistic manner with spatial-temporal relationships learned through 3D convolutions. The flow-to-frame synthesis is modeled as a generative process in order to keep the predicted results lying closer to the manifold shape of real video sequence. Such a two-phase design prevents the model from directly looking at the high-dimensional pixel space of the frame sequence and is demonstrated to be more effective in predicting better and diverse results. Extensive experimental results on videos with different types of motion show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against existing methods in terms of quality, diversity and human perceptual evaluation.",

In the closed-loop system, the ability to monitor the state of the task via rich sensory information is important but often less studied. In this work, we take liquid pouring as a concrete example and aim at learning to continuously monitor whether liquid pouring is successful (e.g., no spilling) or not via rich sensory inputs. We mimic humans' rich sensories using synchronized observation from a chest-mounted camera and a wrist-mounted IMU sensor. Given many success and failure demonstrations of liquid pouring, we train a hierarchical LSTM with late fusion for monitoring. To improve the robustness of the system, we propose two auxiliary tasks during training: inferring (1) the initial state of containers and (2) forecasting the one-step future 3D trajectory of the hand with an adversarial training procedure. These tasks encourage our method to learn representation sensitive to container states and how objects are manipulated in 3D. With these novel components, our method achieves ~8% and ~11% better monitoring accuracy than the baseline method without auxiliary tasks on unseen containers and unseen users respectively.",

Although the recent success of deep networks has led many state-of-the-art methods for 3D pose estimation to train deep networks end-to-end to predict from images directly, the top-performing approaches have shown the effectiveness of dividing the task of 3D pose estimation into two steps: using a state-of-the-art 2D pose estimator to estimate the 2D pose from images and then mapping them into 3D space. They also showed that a low-dimensional representation like 2D locations of a set of joints can be discriminative enough to estimate 3D pose with high accuracy. However, estimation of 3D pose for individual frames leads to temporally incoherent estimates due to independent error in each frame causing jitter. Therefore, in this work we utilize the temporal information across a sequence of 2D joint locations to estimate a sequence of 3D poses. We designed a sequence-to-sequence network composed of layer-normalized LSTM units with shortcut connections connecting the input to the output on the decoder side and imposed temporal smoothness constraint during training. We found that the knowledge of temporal consistency improves the best reported result on Human3.6M dataset by approximately $12.2%$ and helps our network to recover temporally consistent 3D poses over a sequence of images even when the 2D pose detector fails.",

		"title": "Localization Recall Precision (LRP): A New Performance Metric for Object Detection",

Despite its wide acceptance, it has a number of shortcomings, the most important of which are (i) the inability to distinguish very different RP curves, and (ii) the lack of directly measuring bounding box localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose \"Localization Recall Precision (LRP) Error\", a new metric specifically designed for object detection. LRP Error is composed of three components related to localization, false negative (FN) rate and false positive (FP) rate. Based on LRP, we introduce the \"Optimal LRP\" (oLRP), the minimum achievable LRP error representing the best achievable configuration of the detector in terms of recall-precision and the tightness of the boxes. In contrast to AP, which considers precisions over the entire recall domain, oLRP determines the \"best\" confidence score threshold for a class, which balances the trade-off between localization and recall-precision. In our experiments, we show that oLRP provides richer and more discriminative information than AP. We also demonstrate that the best confidence score thresholds vary significantly among classes and detectors. Moreover, we present LRP results of a simple online video object detector and show that the class-specific optimized thresholds increase the accuracy against the common approach of using a general threshold for all classes. Our experiments demonstrate that LRP is more competent than AP in capturing the performance of detectors.

One of recent approaches to this problem is to estimate parameters of a global transformation model that densely aligns one image to the other. Since an entire correlation map between all feature pairs across images is typically used to predict such a global transformation, noisy features from different backgrounds, clutter, and occlusion distract the predictor from correct estimation of the alignment. This is a challenging issue, in particular, in the problem of semantic correspondence where a large degree of image variations is often involved. In this paper, we introduce an attentive semantic alignment method that focuses on reliable correlations, filtering out distractors. For effective attention, we also propose an offset-aware correlation kernel that learns to capture translation-invariant local transformations in computing correlation values over spatial locations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the attentive model and offset-aware kernel, and the proposed model combining both techniques achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

We propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node into two groups, obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification problem that can be a handled with a light-weight CNN weak learner. Code uniqueness is achieved via the random class grouping, whilst code consistency is achieved using a low-rank loss in the CNN weak learners that encourages intra-class compactness for the two random class groups. Finally, we introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code, producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class.

We train a CNN to regress an SVBRDF and surface normals from this image. Our network is trained using a large-scale SVBRDF dataset and designed to incorporate physical insights for material estimation, including an in-network rendering layer to model appearance and a material classification task to provide additional supervision during training. Finally, we refine the results from the network using a dense CRF module whose terms are designed specifically for our task.

		"abstract": "Convolution is spatially-symmetric, i.e., the visual features are independent of its position in the image, which limits its ability to use spatial information. This paper addresses this issue by a recalibration process, which refers to the surrounding region of each neuron, computes an importance value and multiplies it to the original neural response. Our approach is named multi-scale spatially-asymmetric recalibration (MS-SAR), which, besides introducing spatial asymmetry into convolution, extracts visual cues from regions at multiple scales to allow richer information to be incorporated. MS-SAR is implemented in an efficient way, so that only small fractions of extra parameters and computations are required. We apply MS-SAR to several popular network architectures, in which all convolutional layers are recalibrated, and demonstrate superior performance in both CIFAR and ILSVRC2012 classification tasks.",

Recent practice on domain adaptation manages to extract effective features by incorporating the pseudo labels for the target domain to better solve cross-domain distribution divergences. However, existing approaches separate target label optimization and domain-invariant feature learning as different steps. To address that issue, we develop a novel Graph Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (GAKT) model to jointly optimize target labels and domain-free features in a unified framework. Specifically, semi-supervised knowledge adaptation and label propagation on target data are coupled to benefit each other, and hence the marginal and conditional disparities across different domains will be better alleviated.

This paper is in the vein of supervised video summarization using sequential determinantal point processes (SeqDPPs), which models diversity by a probabilistic distribution. We improve this model in two folds. In terms of learning, we propose a large-margin algorithm to address the exposure bias problem in SeqDPP. In terms of modeling, we design a new probabilistic distribution such that, when it is integrated into SeqDPP, the resulting model accepts user input about the expected length of the summary. Moreover, we also significantly extend a popular video summarization dataset by 1) more egocentric videos, 2) dense user annotations, and 3) a refined evaluation scheme.

Our network extends unsupervised image-to-image translation to multi-view ``specular to diffuse\" translation. To preserve object appearance across multiple views, we introduce a Multi-View Coherence loss (MVC) that evaluates the similarity and faithfulness of local patches after the view-transformation. Our MVC loss ensures that the similarity of local correspondences among multi-view images is preserved under the image-to-image translation. As a result, our network yields significantly better results than several single-view baseline techniques. In addition, we carefully design and generate a large synthetic training data set using physically-based rendering. During testing, our network takes only the raw glossy images as input, without extra information such as segmentation masks or lighting estimation. Results demonstrate that multi-view reconstruction can be significantly improved using the images filtered by our network.

		"title": "RESOUND: Towards Action Recognition without Representation Bias",
		"abstract": "While large datasets have proven to be a key enabler for progress in computer vision, they can have biases that lead to erroneous conclusions. The notion of the representation bias of a dataset is proposed to combat this problem. It captures the fact that representations other than the ground-truth representation can achieve good performance on any given dataset. When this is the case, the dataset is said not to be well calibrated. Dataset calibration is shown to be a necessary condition for the standard state-of-the-art evaluation practice to converge to the ground-truth representation. A procedure, RESOUND, is proposed to quantify and minimize representation bias. Its application to the problem of action recognition shows that current datasets are biased towards static representations (objects, scenes and people). Two versions of RESOUND are studied. An Explicit RESOUND procedure is proposed to assemble new datasets by sampling existing datasets. An implicit RESOUND procedure is used to guide the creation of a new dataset, Diving48, of over 18,000 video clips of competitive diving actions, spanning 48 ﬁne-grained dive classes. Experimental evaluation conﬁrms the eﬀectiveness of RESOUND to reduce the static biases of current datasets.",

Nevertheless, we believe that traditional approaches such as L2 distance or Dynamic Time Warping based on hand-crafted local pose metrics fail to appropriately capture the semantic relationship across motions and, as such, are not suitable for being employed as metrics within these tasks. This work addresses this limitation by means of a triplet-based deep metric learning specifically tailored to deal with human motion data, in particular with the problem of varying input size and computationally expensive hard negative mining due to motion pair alignment. Specifically, we propose (1) a novel metric learning objective based on a triplet architecture and Maximum Mean Discrepancy; as well as, (2) a novel deep architecture based on attentive recurrent neural networks. One benefit of our objective function is that it enforces a better separation within the learned embedding space of the different motion categories by means of the associated distribution moments. At the same time, our attentive recurrent neural network allows processing varying input sizes to a fixed size of embedding while learning to focus on those motion parts that are semantically distinctive. Our experiments on two different datasets demonstrate significant improvements over conventional human motion metrics.",

Instead of learning to enforce semantic labels on individual pixels, we propose to enforce affinity field patterns in individual pixel neighbourhoods, i.e., the semantic label patterns of whether neighbour pixels are in the same segment should match between the prediction and the ground-truth. The affinity fields thus characterize the intrinsic geometric relationships inside a given scene, such as ``motorcycles have round wheels''. We further develop a novel method for learning the optimal neighbourhood size for each semantic category, with an adversarial loss that optimizes over worst-case scenarios. Unlike the popular Conditional Random Field approaches, our adaptive affinity field method has no extra parameters during inference, and is also less sensitive to input appearance changes. Extensive evaluations on Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012 and GTA5 datasets demonstrate AAF provides an effective, efficient, and robust solution for semantic segmentation.",

This suggests that existing network of experts approaches that organize classes into coarse categories are suboptimal. In contrast, we group images based on high-level appearance features rather than their class membership and dedicate a specialist model per group. In addition, we propose an alternating architecture with a global ordered- and a global orderless-representation to account for both the coarse layout of the scene and the transient objects. We demonstrate that it leads to better performance than using a single type of representation as well as the fused features.

Existing MTL methods follow a design pattern of shared bottom CNN layers and task-specific top layers. However, the sharing architecture is usually heuristically chosen, as it is difficult to decide which layers should be shared. Our approach is composed of (1) a novel MTL framework that automatically learns which layers to share through optimisation under tensor trace norm regularisation and (2) an invariant representation learning approach that allows the CNN to leverage tasks defined on disjoint datasets without suffering from dataset distribution shift. To advance subtle expression recognition, we contribute a Large-scale Subtle Emotions and Mental States in the Wild database (LSEMSW). LSEMSW includes a variety of cognitive states as well as basic emotions. It contains 176K images, manually annotated with 13 emotions, and thus provides the first subtle expression dataset large enough for training deep CNNs.

		"abstract": "Designing discriminative and invariant features is the key to visual recognition. Recently, the bilinear pooled feature matrix of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of fine-grained visual recognition tasks. The bilinear feature matrix collects second-order statistics and is closely related to the covariance matrix descriptor. However, the bilinear feature could suffer from the visual burstiness phenomenon similar to other visual representations such as VLAD and Fisher Vector. The reason is that the bilinear feature matrix is sensitive to the magnitudes and correlations of local CNN feature elements which can be measured by its singular values. On the other hand, the singular vectors are more invariant and reasonable to be adopted as the feature representation. Motivated by this point, we advocate an alternative pooling method which transforms the CNN feature matrix to an orthonormal matrix consists of its principal singular vectors. Geometrically, such orthonormal matrix lies on the Grassmann manifold, a Riemannian manifold whose points represent subspaces of the Euclidean space. Similarity measurement of images reduces to comparing the principal angles between these ``homogeneous\" subspaces and thus is independent of the magnitudes and correlations of local CNN activations. In particular, we demonstrate that the projection distance on the Grassmann manifold deduces a bilinear feature mapping without explicitly computing the bilinear feature matrix, which enables a very compact feature and classifier representation. Experimental results show that our method achieves an excellent balance of model complexity and accuracy on a variety of fine-grained image classification datasets.",

		"abstract": "We consider the semi-supervised multi-class classification problem of learning from sparse labelled and abundant unlabelled training data. To address this problem, existing semi-supervised deep learning methods often rely on the up-to-date “network-in-training” to formulate the semi-supervised learning objective. This ignores both the discriminative feature representation and the model inference uncertainty revealed by the network in the preceding learning iterations, referred to as the memory of model learning. In this work, we propose a novel Memory-Assisted Deep Neural Network (MA-DNN) capable of exploiting the memory of model learning to enable semi-supervised learning. Specifically, we introduce a memory mechanism into the network training process as an assimilation-accommodation interaction between the network and an external memory module. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed MA-DNN model over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep learning methods on three image classification benchmark datasets: SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100.",

		"abstract": "Visual tracking is confronted by the dilemma to locate a target both}accurately and efficiently, and make decisions online whether and how to adapt the appearance model or even restart tracking. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning with iterative shift (DRL-IS) method for single object tracking, where an actor-critic network is introduced to predict the iterative shifts of object bounding boxes, and evaluate the shifts to take actions on whether to update object models or re-initialize tracking. Since locating an object is achieved by an iterative shift process, rather than online classification on many sampled locations, the proposed method is robust to cope with large deformations and abrupt motion, and computationally efficient since finding a target takes up to 10 shifts. In offline training, the critic network guides to learn how to make decisions jointly on motion estimation and tracking status in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on the OTB benchmarks with large deformation improve the tracking precision by 1.7% and runs about 5 times faster than the competing state-of-the-art methods.",

This model can then be used for lightweight, sophisticated video and image editing. We make the following three contributions. First, we introduce a network, X2Face, that can control a source face (specified by one or more frames) using another face in a driving frame to produce a generated frame with the identity of the source frame but the pose and expression of the face in the driving frame. Second, we propose a method for training the network fully self-supervised using a large collection of video data. Third, we show that the generation process can be driven by other modalities, such as audio or pose codes, without any further training of the network. The generation results for driving a face with another face are compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised/supervised methods. We show that our approach is more robust than other methods, as it makes fewer assumptions about the input data. We also show examples of using our framework for video face editing.",

		"title": "Correcting the Triplet Selection Bias for Triplet Loss",
		"abstract": "Triplet loss, popular for metric learning, has made a great success in many computer vision tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, image retrieval, and face recognition. Considering that the number of triplets grows cubically with the size of training data, triplet mining is thus indispensable for efficiently training with triplet loss. However, in practice, the training is usually very sensitive to the selected triplets, e.g., it almost does not converge with randomly selected triplets and selecting hardest triplets also leads to bad local minima. We argue that the bias in sampling of triplets degrades the performance of learning with triplet loss. In this paper, we propose a new variant of triplet loss, which tries to reduce the bias in triplet sampling by adaptively correcting the distribution shift on sampled triplets. We refer to this new triplet loss as adapted triplet loss. We conduct a number of experiments on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST for image classification, and on CARS196, CUB200-2011, and Stanford Online Products for image retrieval. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

		"title": "Women also Snowboard: Overcoming Bias in Captioning Models",
		"abstract": "Most machine learning methods are known to capture and exploit biases of the training data. While some biases are beneficial for learning, others are harmful. Specifically, image captioning models tend to exaggerate biases present in training data (e.g., if a word is present in 60% of training sentences, it might be predicted in 70% of sentences at test time). This can lead to incorrect captions in domains where unbiased captions are desired, or required, due to over-reliance on the learned prior and image context. In this work we investigate generation of gender-specific caption words (e.g. man, woman) based on the person's appearance or the image context. We introduce a new Equalizer model that encourages equal gender probability when gender evidence is occluded in a scene and confident predictions when gender evidence is present. The resulting model is forced to look at a person rather than use contextual cues to make a gender-specific prediction. The losses that comprise our model, the Appearance Confusion Loss and the Confident Loss, are general, and can be added to any description model in order to mitigate impacts of unwanted bias in a description dataset. Our proposed model has lower error than prior work when describing images with people and mentioning their gender and more closely matches the ground truth ratio of sentences including women to sentences including men. Finally, we show that our model more often looks at people when predicting their gender.",

However, such point-point loss does not constrain the 3D model from a global perspective. We propose to add geometric adversarial loss (GAL). It is composed of two terms where the geometric loss ensures consistent shape of reconstructed 3D models close to ground-truth from different viewpoints, and the conditional adversarial loss generates a semantically-meaningful point cloud. GAL benefits predicting the obscured part of objects and maintaining geometric structure of the predicted 3D model.

We also use simple heuristics to guide the propagation of local textures from the boundary to the hole. We show that, by using such techniques, inpainting reduces to the problem of learning two image-feature translation functions in much smaller space and hence easier to train.

		"title": "Inner Space Preserving Generative Pose Machine",

However, most successful frameworks share a common procedure which performs an image-to-image translation with pose of figures in the image untouched. When the objective is reposing a figure in an image while preserving the rest of the image, the state-of-the-art mainly assumes a single rigid body with simple background and limited pose shift, which can hardly be extended to the images under normal settings. In this paper, we introduce an image ``inner space'' preserving model that assigns an interpretable low-dimensional pose descriptor (LDPD) to an articulated figure in the image. Figure reposing is then generated by passing the LDPD and the original image through multi-stage augmented hourglass networks in a conditional GAN structure, called inner space preserving generative pose machine (ISP-GPM). We evaluated ISP-GPM on reposing human figures, which are highly articulated with versatile variations. Test of a state-of-the-art pose estimator on our reposed dataset gave an accuracy over 80% on PCK0.5 metric. The results also elucidated that our ISP-GPM is able to preserve the background with high accuracy while reasonably recovering the area blocked by the figure to be reposed.",

		"abstract": "Object detection is a fundamental and important problem in computer vision. Although impressive results have been achieved on large/medium sized objects on large-scale detection benchmarks (e.g. the COCO dataset), the performance on small objects is far from satisfaction. The reason is that small objects lack sufficient detailed appearance information, which can distinguish them from the background or similar objects. To deal with small object detection problem, we propose an end-to-end multi-task generative adversarial network (MTGAN). In the MTGAN, the generator is a super-resolution network, which can up-sample small blurred images into fine-scale ones and recover detailed information for more accurate detection. The discriminator is a multi task network, which describes each super-resolution image patch with a real/fake score, object category scores, and bounding box regression off sets. Furthermore, to make the generator recover more details for easier detection, the classification and regression losses in the discriminator are back-propagated into the generator during training. Extensive experiments on the challenging COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in restoring a clear super-resolution image from a blurred small one, and show that the detection performance, especially for small sized objects, improves over state-of-the-art methods.",

Unlike traditional single media (an image or video) setting, we encounter a set of heterogeneous contents containing orderless images and videos. The importance of each image is usually considered either equal or based on their independent quality assessment. How to model the relationship of orderless images within a set remains a challenge. We address this problem by formulating it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) at the feature level. Specifically, we propose a dependency-aware attention control (DAC) network, which resorts to actor-critic reinforcement learning for sequential attention decision of each image embedding to fully exploit the rich correlation cues among the unordered images. Moreover, its sample-efficient variant with off-policy experience replay is introduced to speed up the learning process. The pose-guided representation scheme can further boost the performance at the extremes of the pose variation.

Specifically, 2D strided convolutions operated on stacked EPIs and detail-restoration 3D CNNs connected with angular conversion are assembled to build the Pseudo 4DCNN. The key advantage is to efficiently synthesize dense 4D light fields from a sparse set of input views. The learning framework is well formulated as an entirely trainable problem, and all the weights can be recursively updated with standard backpropagation. The proposed framework is compared with state-of-the-art approaches on both genuine and synthetic light field databases, which achieves significant improvements of both image quality (+2dB higher) and computational efficiency (over 10X faster). Furthermore, the proposed framework shows good performances in real-world applications such as biometrics and depth estimation.",

		"abstract": "Weight pruning methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) have been investigated recently, but prior work in this area is mainly heuristic, iterative pruning, thereby lacking guarantees on the weight reduction ratio and convergence time. To mitigate these limitations, we present a systematic weight pruning framework of DNNs using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We first formulate the weight pruning problem of DNNs as a nonconvex optimization problem with combinatorial constraints specifying the sparsity requirements, and then adopt the ADMM framework for systematic weight pruning. By using ADMM, the original nonconvex optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems that are solved iteratively. One of these subproblems can be solved using stochastic gradient descent, the other can be solved analytically. Besides, our method achieves a fast convergence rate. The weight pruning results are very promising and consistently outperform the prior work. On the LeNet-5 model for the MNIST data set, we achieve 71.2 times weight reduction without accuracy loss. On the AlexNet model for the ImageNet data set, we achieve 21 times weight reduction without accuracy loss. When we focus on the convolutional layer pruning for computation reductions, we can reduce the total computation by five times compared with the prior work (achieving a total of 13.4 times weight reduction in convolutional layers).

To address this, we design a PA-DRL to exploit the structure of the human body by extracting skeleton proposals under a deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we extract features from different parts of the human body individually and activate the action-related parts in features to enhance the representation. Our method not only exploits the structure information of the human body, but also considers the saliency part for expressing actions. We evaluate our method on three popular action prediction datasets: UT-Interaction, BIT-Interaction and UCF101. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the performance with state-of-the-arts.",

Finding those subtle traits that fully characterize the object is not straightforward. To handle this circumstance, we propose a novel self-supervision mechanism to effectively localize informative regions without the need of fine-grained bounding-box/part annotations. Our model, termed NTS-Net for Navigator-Teacher-Scrutinizer Network, consists of a Navigator agent, a Teacher agent and a Scrutinizer agent. In consideration of intrinsic consistency between informativeness of the regions and their probability being ground-truth class, we design a novel training paradigm, which enables Navigator to detect most informative regions under the guidance from Teacher. After that, the Scrutinizer scrutinizes the proposed regions from Navigator and makes predictions. Our model can be viewed as a multi-agent cooperation, wherein agents benefit from each other, and make progress together. NTS-Net can be trained end-to-end, while provides accurate fine-grained classification predictions as well as highly informative regions during inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in extensive benchmark datasets.",

This model is motivated by the observation that the specular highlight of a natural image usually has large intensity but is rather sparsely distributed while the remaining diffuse reflection can be well approximated by a linear combination of several distinct colors with a sparse and low-rank weighting matrix. We further impose the non-negativity constraint on the weighting matrix as well as the highlight component to ensure that the model is purely additive. With this reflection model, we reformulate the task of highlight removal as a constrained nuclear norm and $l_1$-norm minimization problem which can be solved effectively by the augmented Lagrange multiplier method. Experimental results show that our method performs well on both synthetic images and many real-world examples and is competitive with previous methods, especially in some challenging scenarios featuring natural illumination, hue-saturation ambiguity and strong noises.",

This paper presents an exemplar-based subspace clustering method to tackle the problem of imbalanced and large-scale datasets. The proposed method searches for a subset of the data that best represents all data points as measured by the $ell_1$-norm of the representation coefficients. To solve our model efficiently, we introduce a farthest first search algorithm which iteratively selects the least well-represented point as an exemplar. When data comes from a union of subspaces, we prove that the computed subset contains enough exemplars from each subspace for expressing all data points even if the data are imbalanced.

Traditional computer vision-based approaches using temporal smoothing only take into account the kinematics of the motion without considering the physics that underlies the dynamics of motion, which leads to pose estimates that are physically invalid. Motivated by this, we propose a novel control-based approach to model human motion with physics simulation and use imitation learning to learn a video-conditioned control policy for ego-pose estimation. Our imitation learning framework allows us to perform domain adaption to transfer our policy trained on simulation data to real-world data.

		"abstract": "Visual dialog entails answering a series of questions grounded in an image, using dialog history as context. In addition to the challenges found in visual question answering (VQA), which can be seen as one-round dialog, visual dialog encompasses several more. We focus on one such problem called ‘visual coreference resolution’ that involves determining which words, typically noun phrases and pronouns, ‘co-refer’ to the same entity/object instance in an image. This is crucial, especially for pronouns (e.g., ‘it'), as the dialog agent must first link it to a previous coreference (e.g., ‘boat'), and only then can rely on the visual grounding of the coreference ‘boat' to reason about the pronoun `it'. Prior work (in visual dialog) models visual coreference resolution either (a) implicitly via a memory network over history, or (b) at a coarse level for the entire question; and not explicitly at a phrase level of granularity. In this work, we propose a neural module network architecture for visual dialog by introducing two novel modules---Refer and Exclude---that perform explicit, grounded, coreference resolution at a finer word level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on MNIST Dialog, a visually simple yet coreference-wise complex dataset, by achieving near perfect accuracy, and on VisDial, a large and challenging visual dialog dataset on real images, where our model outperforms other approaches, and is more interpretable, grounded, and consistent qualitatively.",

We introduce a novel reconstruction loss that is more robust to noise and texture-less patches, and is invariant to illumination changes. The proposed loss is optimized using a window-based cost aggregation with an adaptive support weight scheme. This cost aggregation is edge-preserving and smooths the loss function, which is key to allow the network to reach compelling results.

In real world applications, a dynamic scene is commonly captured by a moving camera (i.e., panning, tilting or hand-held), increasing the task complexity because the scene is observed from different view points. The main challenge is the disambiguation of the camera motion from scene motion, which becomes more difficult as the amount of rigidity observed decreases, even with successful estimation of 2D image correspondences. Compared to other state-of-the-art 3D scene flow estimation methods, in this paper we propose to emph{learn} the rigidity of a scene in a supervised manner from a large collection of dynamic scene data, and directly infer a rigidity mask from two sequential images with depths. With the learned network, we show how we can effectively estimate camera motion and projected scene flow using computed 2D optical flow and the inferred rigidity mask. For training and testing the rigidity network, we also provide a new semi-synthetic dynamic scene dataset (synthetic foreground objects with a real background) and an evaluation split that accounts for the percentage of observed non-rigid pixels.

Within the group testing framework we propose an efficient off-line construction of the search structures. The linear-time complexity orthogonal grouping increases the probability that at most one element from each group is matching to a given query. Non-maxima suppression with each group efficiently reduces the number of false positive results at no extra cost. Unlike in other well-performing approaches, all processing is local, fast, and suitable to process data in batches and in parallel. We experimentally show that the proposed method achieves search accuracy of the exhaustive search with significant reduction in the search complexity.

In particular, our model explicitly represents the gaze direction and handles out-of-frame gaze targets. We leverage three different datasets using a multi-task learning approach.

Most traditional approaches imitate the language structure patterns, thus tend to fall into a stereotype of replicating frequent phrases or sentences and neglect unique aspects of each image. In this work, we propose an image captioning framework with a self-retrieval module as training guidance, which encourages generating discriminative captions. It brings unique advantages: (1) the self-retrieval guidance can act as a metric and an evaluator of caption discriminativeness to assure the quality of generated captions. (2) The correspondence between generated captions and images are naturally incorporated in the generation process without human annotations, and hence our approach could utilize a large amount of unlabeled images to boost captioning performance with no additional laborious annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval-guided method on COCO and Flickr30k captioning datasets, and show its superior captioning performance with more discriminative captions.",

Recent works formulate video object segmentation as a prediction task using deep nets to achieve appealing state-of-the-art performance. Due to the formulation as a prediction task, most of these methods require fine-tuning during test time, such that the deep nets memorize the appearance of the objects of interest in the given video. However, fine-tuning is time-consuming and computationally expensive, hence the algorithms are far from real time. To address this issue, we develop a novel matching based algorithm for video object segmentation. In contrast to memorization based classification techniques, the proposed approach learns to match extracted features to a provided template without memorizing the appearance of the objects. We validate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method on the challenging DAVIS-2016, DAVIS-2017, Youtube-Objects and JumpCut datasets.

Therefore, we are interested in learning object-agnostic visual features for more generalizable relationship models. By ``agnostic'', we mean that the feature is less likely biased to the classes of paired objects. To alleviate the bias, we propose a novel Shuffle-Then-Assemble pre-training strategy. First, we discard all the triplet relationship annotations in an image, leaving two unpaired object domains without obj1-obj2 alignment. Then, our feature learning is to recover possible obj1-obj2 pairs. In particular, we design a cycle of residual transformations between the two domains, where the identity mappings encourage the RoI features to capture shared but not object-specific visual patterns. Extensive experiments on two visual relationship benchmarks show that by using our pre-trained features, naive relationship models can be consistently improved and even outperform other state-of-the-art relationship models.",

Following this approach we retrain and adapt existing architectures to recover scene depth and 3D pose of vehicles from monocular panoramic imagery without any panoramic training labels or calibration parameters.

		"title": "Towards Realistic Predictors",
		"abstract": "A new class of predictors, denoted realistic predictors, is defined. These are predictors that, like humans, assess the difficulty of examples, reject to work on those that are deemed too hard, but guarantee good performance on the ones they operate on. In this paper, we talk about a particular case of it, realistic classifiers. The central problem in realistic classification, the design of an inductive predictor of hardness scores, is considered. It is argued that this should be a predictor independent of the classifier itself, but tuned to it, and learned without explicit supervision, so as to learn from its mistakes. A new architecture is proposed to accomplish these goals by complementing the classifier with an auxiliary hardness prediction network (HP-Net). Sharing the same inputs as classifiers, the HP-Net outputs the hardness scores to be fed to the classifier as loss weights. Alternatively, the output of classifiers is also fed to HP-Net in a new defined loss, variant of cross entropy loss. The two networks are trained jointly in an adversarial way where, as the classifier learns to improve its predictions, the HP-Net refines its hardness scores. Given the learned hardness predictor, a simple implementation of realistic classifiers is proposed by rejecting examples with large scores. Experimental results not only provide evidence in support of the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and the learned hardness predictor, but also show that the realistic classifier always improves performance on the examples that it accepts to classify, performing better on these examples than an equivalent nonrealistic classifier. All of these make it possible for realistic classifiers to guarantee a good performance.",

We address this issue with our approach to learn deep neural networks incrementally, using new data and only a small exemplar set corresponding to samples from the old classes. This is based on a loss composed of a distillation measure to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, and a cross-entropy loss to learn the new classes. Our incremental training is achieved while keeping the entire framework end-to-end, i.e., learning the data representation and the classifier jointly, unlike recent methods with no such guarantees.

One strategy for mitigating noise in low-light situations is to increase the shutter time, allowing each photosite to integrate more light and decrease noise variance. However, there are two downsides of long exposures: (a) bright regions can exceed the sensor range, and (b) camera and scene motion will cause blur. Another way of gathering more light is to capture multiple short (thus noisy) frames in a “burst” and intelligently integrate the content, thus avoiding the above downsides. In this paper, we use the burst-capture strategy and implement the intelligent integration via a recurrent fully convolutional deep neural net (CNN). We build our novel, multi-frame architecture to be a simple addition to any single frame denoising model. The resulting architecture denoises all frames in a sequence of arbitrary length.

		"abstract": "In recent deep online and near-online multi-object tracking approaches, a difficulty has been to incorporate long-term appearance models to efficiently score object tracks under severe occlusion and multiple missing detections. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent network model, the bilinear LSTM, in order to improve long-term appearance models via a recurrent network. Based on intuitions drawn from recursive least squares, bilinear LSTM stores building blocks of a linear predictor in its memory, which is then coupled with the input in a multiplicative manner, instead of the additive coupling in conventional LSTM approaches. Such coupling resembles an online learned classifier/regressor at each time step, which we have found to improve performances in using LSTM for appearance modeling. We also propose novel data augmentation approaches to efficiently train recurrent models that score object tracks on both appearance and motion. We train an LSTM that can score object tracks based on both appearance and motion and utilize it in a multiple hypothesis tracking framework. In experiments, we show that with our novel LSTM model, we achieved state-of-the-art performance on near-online multiple object tracking on the MOT 2016 and MOT 2017 benchmarks.",

		"abstract": "In this work, we propose a method that combines a single hand-held camera and a set of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) attached at the body limbs to estimate accurate 3D poses in the wild. This poses many new challenges: the moving camera, heading drift, cluttered background, occlusions and many people visible in the video. We associate 2D pose detections in each image to the corresponding IMU-equipped persons by solving a novel graph based optimization problem that forces 3D to 2D coherency within a frame and across long range frames. Given associations, we jointly optimize the pose of a statistical body model, the camera pose and heading drift using a continuous optimization framework. We validated our method on the TotalCapture dataset, which provides video and IMU synchronized with ground truth. We obtain an accuracy of 26mm, which makes it accurate enough to serve as a benchmark for image-based 3D pose estimation in the wild. Using our method, we recorded 3D Poses in the Wild (3DPW ), a new dataset consisting of more than 51; 000 frames with accurate 3D pose in challenging sequences, including walking in the city, going up-stairs, having coffee or taking the bus.

Although considerable progress has been made in semantic scene understanding, it is mainly related to clear-weather scenes.

In addition, we present three other main stand-alone contributions: 1) a novel method to add synthetic fog to real, clear-weather scenes using semantic input; 2) a new fog density estimator; 3) the Foggy Zurich dataset comprising 3808 real foggy images, with pixel-level semantic annotations for 16 images with dense fog. Our experiments show that 1) our fog simulation slightly outperforms a state-of-the-art competing simulation with respect to the task of semantic foggy scene understanding (SFSU); 2) CMAda improves the performance of state-of-the-art models for SFSU significantly by leveraging unlabeled real foggy data.

To solve this problem, NetAdapt incorporates direct metrics into its adaptation algorithm. These direct metrics are evaluated using empirical measurements, so that detailed knowledge of the platform and toolchain is not required. NetAdapt automatically and progressively simplifies a pre-trained network until the resource budget is met while maximizing the accuracy. Experiment results show that NetAdapt achieves better accuracy versus latency trade-offs on both mobile CPU and mobile GPU, compared with the state-of-the-art automated network simplification algorithms. For image classification on the ImageNet dataset, NetAdapt achieves up to a 1.7x speedup in measured inference latency with equal or higher accuracy on MobileNets (V1&V2).",

Benefiting from the low number of required correspondences, robust estimators like LO-RANSAC need fewer samples, and thus terminate earlier than using the five-point method.

Interestingly, the most frequently used non-linearities in imaging applications (variants of the rectified linear unit) are uncommon in low dimensional approximation problems. In this paper we propose a novel non-linear transfer function, called lifting, which is motivated from a related technique in convex optimization. A lifting layer increases the dimensionality of the input, naturally yields a linear spline when combined with a fully connected layer, and therefore closes the gap between low and high dimensional approximation problems. Moreover, applying the lifting operation to the loss layer of the network allows us to handle non-convex and flat (zero-gradient) cost functions. We analyze the proposed lifting theoretically, exemplify interesting properties in synthetic experiments and demonstrate its effectiveness in deep learning approaches to image classification and denoising.",

Instead of using external resources like pose estimator, we consider content consistency within each part for precise part location. Specifically, we target at learning discriminative part-informed features for person retrieval and make two contributions. (i) A network named Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB). Given an image input, it outputs a convolutional descriptor consisting of several part-level features. With a uniform partition strategy, PCB achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art methods, proving itself as a strong convolutional baseline for person retrieval. (ii) A refined part pooling (RPP) method. Uniform partition inevitably incurs outliers in each part, which are in fact more similar to other parts. RPP re-assigns these outliers to the parts they are closest to, resulting in refined parts with enhanced within-part consistency. Experiment confirms that RPP allows PCB to gain another round of performance boost.

Our approach SaGAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator contains an attribute manipulation network (AMN) to edit the face image, and a spatial attention network (SAN) to localize the attribute-specific region which restricts the alternation of AMN within this region.

Here we show that no single saliency map can perform well under all metrics. Instead, we propose a principled approach to solve the benchmarking problem by separating the notions of saliency models, maps and metrics. Inspired by Bayesian decision theory, we define a saliency model to be a probabilistic model of fixation density prediction and a saliency map to be a metric-specific prediction derived from the model density which maximizes the expected performance on that metric given the model density. We derive these optimal saliency maps for the most commonly used saliency metrics (AUC, sAUC, NSS, CC, SIM, KL-Div) and show that they can be computed analytically or approximated with high precision. We show that this leads to consistent rankings in all metrics and avoids the penalties of using one saliency map for all metrics. Our method allows researchers to have their model compete on many different metrics with state-of-the-art in those metrics: \"good\" models will perform well in all metrics.",

However, it is difficult to fully exploit the distribution of complex data, like images and videos, due to the high dimensionality of ambient space. Sequentially, how to effectively guide the training of generative models is a crucial issue. In this paper, we present a subspace-based generative adversarial network (Sub-GAN) which simultaneously disentangles multiple latent subspaces and generates diverse samples correspondingly. Since the high-dimensional natural data usually lies on a union of low-dimensional subspaces which contain semantically extensive structure, Sub-GAN incorporates a novel clusterer that can interact with the generator and discriminator via subspace information. Unlike the traditional generative models, the proposed Sub-GAN can control the diversity of the generated samples via the multiplicity of the learned subspaces. Moreover, the Sub-GAN follows an unsupervised fashion to explore not only the visual classes but the latent continuous attributes. We demonstrate that our model can discover meaningful visual attributes which is hard to be annotated via strong supervision, e.g., the writing style of digits, thus avoid the mode collapse problem. Extensive experimental results show the competitive performance of the proposed method for both generating diverse images with satisfied quality and discovering discriminative latent subspaces.",

Consequently, it is of great importance to develop an unconstrained UAV benchmark to boost related researches.

In this field, convolutional neural networks achieved top-performance compared to other known techniques in the literature by processing local information to tell disparity assignments from outliers. Despite this outstanding achievements, all approaches rely on clues extracted with small receptive fields thus ignoring most of the overall image content. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to exploit nearby and farther clues available from image and disparity domains to obtain a more accurate confidence estimation. While local information is very effective for detecting high frequency patterns, it lacks insights from farther regions in the scene. On the other hand, enlarging the receptive field allows to include clues from farther regions but produces smoother uncertainty estimation, not particularly accurate when dealing with high frequency patterns. For these reasons, we propose in this paper a multi-stage cascaded network to combine the best of the two worlds.

Unfortunately, as the results of our experiments show, predicting these 2D projections using a regular CNN or a Convolutional Pose Machine is highly sensitive to partial occlusions, even when these methods are trained with partially occluded examples. Our solution is to predict heatmaps from multiple small patches independently and to accumulate the results to obtain accurate and robust predictions. Training subsequently becomes challenging because patches with similar appearances but different positions on the object correspond to different heatmaps.

Using the original data features from the full video sequence and their perturbed counterparts, as two separate bags, we develop a binary classification problem that learns a set of discriminative hyperplanes -- as a subspace -- that will separate the two bags from each other. This subspace is then used as a descriptor for the video, dubbed discriminative subspace pooling. As the perturbed features belong to data classes that are likely to be confused with the original features, the discriminative subspace will characterize parts of the feature space that are more representative of the original data, and thus may provide robust video representations. To learn such descriptors, we formulate a subspace learning objective on the Stiefel manifold and resort to Riemannian optimization methods for solving it efficiently.

In this work, we address the above limitations by taking advantage of virtual data collected from driving simulators, and present DU-drive, an unsupervised real-to-virtual domain unification framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. It first transforms real driving data to its less complex counterpart in the virtual domain, and then predicts vehicle control commands from the generated virtual image. Our framework has three unique advantages: 1) it maps driving data collected from a variety of source distributions into a unified domain, effectively eliminating domain shift; 2) the learned virtual representation is simpler than the input real image and closer in form to the \"minimum sufficient statistic\" for the prediction task, which relieves the burden of the compression phase while optimizing the information bottleneck tradeoff and leads to superior prediction performance; 3) it takes advantage of annotated virtual data which is unlimited and free to obtain. Extensive experiments on two public driving datasets and two driving simulators demonstrate the performance superiority and interpretive capability of DU-drive.",

		"abstract": "The large volume of video content and high viewing frequency demand automatic video summarization algorithms, where a key property is the capability of modeling diversity. If videos are lengthy like hours-long egocentric videos, it is necessary to track the temporal structures of the videos and enforce local diversity. The local diversity refers to that the shots selected from a short time duration are diverse but visually similar shots are allowed to co-exist in the summary if they appear far apart in the video. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model, built upon SeqDPP, to dynamically control the time span of a video segment upon which the local diversity is imposed. In particular, we enable SeqDPP to learn to automatically infer how local the local diversity is supposed to be from the input video. The resulting model is extremely involved to train by the hallmark maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). To tackle this problem, we instead devise a reinforcement learning algorithm for training the proposed model. Extensive experiments verify the advantages of our model and the new learning algorithm over SeqDPP and MLE, respectively.",

By building upon ideas from network quantization and pruning, we learn binary masks that ``piggyback'' on an existing network, or are applied to unmodified weights of that network to provide good performance on a new task. These masks are learned in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, and incur a low overhead of 1 bit per network parameter, per task. Even though the underlying network is fixed, the ability to mask individual weights allows for the learning of a large number of filters. We show performance comparable to dedicated fine-tuned networks for a variety of classification tasks, including those with large domain shifts from the initial task (ImageNet), and a variety of network architectures. Unlike prior work, we do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting or competition between tasks, and our performance is agnostic to task ordering.",

Treating these scattered photons as a source of information, we solve an inverse problem based on a 3D radiative transfer model that includes both elastic (Rayleigh) and inelastic (Compton) scattering.

		"title": "Image Generation from Sketch Constraint Using Contextual GAN",
		"abstract": "In this paper we investigate image generation guided by hand sketch. When the input sketch is badly drawn, the output of common image-to-image translation follows the input edges due to the hard condition imposed by the translation process. Instead, we propose to use sketch as weak constraint, where the output edges do not necessarily follow the input edges. We address this problem using a novel joint image completion approach, where the sketch provides the image context for completing, or generating the output image. We train a generated adversarial network, i.e., contextual GAN to learn the joint distribution of sketch and the corresponding image by using joint images. Our contextual GAN has several advantages. First, the simple joint image representation allows for simple and effective learning of joint distribution in the same image-sketch space, which avoids complicated issues in cross-domain learning. Second, while the output is related to its input overall, the generated features exhibit more freedom in appearance and do not strictly align with the input features as previous conditional GANs do. Third, from the joint image's point of view, image and sketch are of no difference, thus exactly the same deep joint image completion network can be used for image-to-sketch generation. Experiments evaluated on three different datasets show that our contextual GAN can generate more realistic images than state-of-the-art conditional GANs on challenging inputs and generalize well on common categories.",

In this way, we alleviate the burden of the costly 3D annotations in real-world dataset. Particularly, we propose a weakly-supervised method, adaptating from fully-annotated synthetic dataset to weakly-labeled real-world dataset with the aid of a depth regularizer, which generates depth maps from predicted 3D pose and serves as weak supervision for 3D pose regression.

		"title": "Deeply Learned Compositional Models for Human Pose Estimation",

Their ability to characterize high-order relationships among body parts helps resolve low-level ambiguities in human pose estimation (HPE). However, prior compositional models make unrealistic assumptions on subpart-part relationships, making them incapable to characterize complex compositional patterns. Moreover, state spaces of their higher-level parts can be exponentially large, complicating both inference and learning. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework, termed as Deeply Learned Compositional Model (DLCM), for HPE. It exploits deep neural networks to learn the compositionality of human bodies. This results in a network with a hierarchical compositional architecture and bottom-up/top-down inference stages. In addition, we propose a novel bone-based part representation. It not only compactly encodes orientations, scales and shapes of parts, but also avoids their potentially large state spaces.

These constituent keys work collaboratively for training, which enables the CMN to obtain an optimal video representation in a larger space. Second, we introduce a multi-saliency embedding algorithm which encodes a variable-length video sequence into a fixed-size matrix representation by discovering multiple saliencies of interest. For example, given a video of car auction, some people are interested in the car, while others are interested in the auction activities. Third, we design an abstract memory on top of the constituent keys. The abstract memory and constituent keys form a layered structure, which makes the CMN more efficient and capable of being scaled, while also retaining the representation capability of the multiple keys. We compare CMN with several state-of-the-art baselines on a new few-shot video classification dataset and show the effectiveness of our approach.",

One striking characteristic of our approach is its ability to process unorganized 3D representations such as point clouds as input, then transforming them internally to ordered structures to be processed via 3D convolutions. In contrast to conventional approaches that maintain either unorganized or organized representations, from input to output, our approach has the advantage of operating on memory efficient input data representations while at the same time exploiting the natural structure of convolutional operations to avoid the redundant computing and storing of spatial information in the network. The network eliminates the need to pre- or post process the raw sensor data. This, together with the fully-convolutional nature of the network, makes it an end-to-end method able to process point clouds of huge spaces or even entire rooms with up to 200k points at once. Another advantage is that our network can produce either an ordered output or map predictions directly onto the input cloud, thus making it suitable as a general-purpose point cloud descriptor applicable to many 3D tasks.

Ideally, the more a network already knows about an image, the better it should be at deciding which layer to compute next. In this work, we propose convolutional networks with adaptive inference graphs (ConvNet-AIG) that adaptively define their network topology conditioned on the input image. Following a high-level structure similar to residual networks (ResNets), ConvNet-AIG decides for each input image on the fly which layers are needed. In experiments on ImageNet we show that ConvNet-AIG learns distinct inference graphs for different categories. Both ConvNet-AIG with 50 and 101 layers outperform their ResNet counterpart, while using 20% and 33% less computations respectively. By grouping parameters into layers for related classes and only executing relevant layers, ConvNet-AIG improves both efficiency and overall classification quality.

The majority of NRSfM methods using the perspective cam- era simply assume that the calibration is known. SCIso-NRSfM leverages the recent powerful differential approaches to NRSfM, based on formu- lating local polynomial constraints, where local means correspondence- wise. In NRSfM, the local shape may be solved from these constraints. In SCIso-NRSfM, the difficulty is to also solve for the focal length as a global variable. We propose to eliminate the shape using resultants, obtaining univariate polynomials for the focal length only, whose sum of squares can then be globally minimized. SCIso-NRSfM thus solves for the focal length by integrating the constraints for all correspondences and the whole image set. Once this is done, the local shape is easily re- covered. Our experiments show that its performance is very close to the state-of-the-art methods that use a calibrated camera.",

		"title": "Using Object Information for Spotting Text",
		"abstract": "Text spotting, also called text detection, is a challenging computer vision task because of cluttered backgrounds, diverse imaging environments, various text sizes and similarity between some objects and characters, e.g., tyre and ’o’. However, text spotting is a vital step in numerous AI and computer vision systems, such as autonomous robots and systems for visually impaired. Due to its potential applications and commercial values, researchers have proposed various deep architectures and methods for text spotting. These methods and architectures concentrate only on text in images, but neglect other information related to text. There exists a strong relationship between certain objects and the presence of text, such as signboards or the absence of text, such as trees. In this paper, a text spotting algorithm based on text and object dependency is proposed. The proposed algorithm consists of two sub-convolutional neural networks and three training stages. For this study, a new NTU-UTOI dataset containing over 22k non-synthetic images with 277k bounding boxes for text and 42 text-related object classes is established. According to our best knowledge, it is the second largest non-synthetic text image database. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets with clutter backgrounds, COCO-Text, MSRA-TD500 and SVT show that the proposed algorithm provides comparable performance to state-of-the-art text spotting methods. Experiments are also performed on our newly established dataset to investigate the effectiveness of object information for text spotting. The experimental results indicate that the object information contributes significantly on the performance gain.",

However, while a (training) dataset could be accurately designed to include a variety of sensory inputs, it is often the case that not all modalities are available in real life (testing) scenarios, where a model has to be deployed. This raises the challenge of how to learn robust representations leveraging multimodal data in the training stage, while considering limitations at test time, such as noisy or missing modalities. This paper presents a new approach for multimodal video action recognition, developed within the unified frameworks of distillation and privileged information, named generalized distillation. Particularly, we consider the case of learning representations from depth and RGB videos, while relying on RGB data only at test time. We propose a new approach to train an hallucination network that learns to distill depth features through multiplicative connections of spatiotemporal representations, leveraging soft labels and hard labels, as well as distance between feature maps. We report state-of-the-art results on video action classification on the largest multimodal dataset available for this task, the NTU RGB+D, as well as on the UWA3DII and Northwestern-UCLA.",

This raises the interest of addressing TAL with weak supervision, namely only video-level annotations are available during training). However, the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised TAL methods only focus on generating good Class Activation Sequence (CAS) over time but conduct simple thresholding on CAS to localize actions. In this paper, we first develop a novel weakly-supervised TAL framework called AutoLoc to directly predict the temporal boundary of each action instance. We propose a novel Outer-Inner-Contrastive (OIC) loss to automatically discover the needed segment-level supervision for training such a boundary predictor.

		"abstract": "We present FusedGAN, a deep network for conditional image synthesis with controllable sampling of diverse images. Fidelity, diversity and controllable sampling are the main quality measures of a good image generation model. Most existing models are insufficient in all three aspects. The FusedGAN can perform controllable sampling of diverse images with very high fidelity. We argue that controllability can be achieved by disentangling the generation process into various stages. In contrast to stacked GANs, where multiple stages of GANs are trained separately with full supervision of labeled intermediate images, the FusedGAN has a single stage pipeline with a built-in stacking of GANs. Also another limitation of the existing methods is that they require fully supervised training data in the form of paired condition and image. For tasks such as text-to-image generation, the limited size of such fully supervised, paired training datasets may easily cause mode collapsing in training, which confronts the generation of diverse samples. Unlike existing methods, which requires full supervision with paired conditions and images, the FusedGAN can effectively leverage more abundant images without corresponding conditions in training, to produce more diverse samples with high fidelity. We achieve this by fusing two generators: one for unconditional image generation, and the other for conditional image generation, where the two partly share a common latent space thereby disentangling the generation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the FusedGAN in fine grained image generation tasks such as text-to-image, and attribute-to-face generation.",

However, normalizing along the batch dimension introduces problems --- BN's error increases rapidly when the batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation. This limits BN's usage for training larger models and transferring features to computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we present Group Normalization (GN) as a simple alternative to BN. GN divides the channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for normalization. GN's computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On ResNet-50 trained in ImageNet, GN has 10.6% lower error than its BN counterpart when using a batch size of 2; when using typical batch sizes, GN is comparably good with BN and outperforms other normalization variants. Moreover, GN can be naturally transferred from pre-training to fine-tuning. GN can outperform its BN-based counterparts for object detection and segmentation in COCO, and for video classification in Kinetics, showing that GN can effectively replace the powerful BN in a variety of tasks. GN can be easily implemented by a few lines of code.",

We propose a model capable of learning to reason about semantically meaningful spatio-temporal interactions in videos. Key to our approach is the choice of performing this reasoning on an object level through the integration of state of the art object instance segmentation networks. This allows the model to learn detailed spatial interactions that exist at a semantic, object-interaction relevant level. We evaluated our method on three standard datasets: the Twenty-BN Something-Something dataset, the VLOG dataset and the EPIC Kitchens dataset, and achieve state of the art results on both.

Instead there is a fundamental process of abstraction and iconic rendering, where overall geometry is warped and salient details are selectively included. In this paper we study this sketching process and attempt to invert it. We model this inversion by translating iconic free-hand sketches to contours that resemble more geometrically realistic projections of object boundaries, and separately factorise out the salient added details. This factorised re-representation makes it easier to match a free-hand sketch to a photo instance of an object. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised image style transfer model based on enforcing a cyclic embedding consistency constraint. A deep FG-SBIR model is then formulated to accommodate complementary discriminative detail from each factorised sketch for better matching with the corresponding photo.

In contrast to these disparate solutions, we propose an optimization based formulation that can be used to achieve these different reconstruction objectives with task-specific cost modeling that uses and construct a very efficient network flow based formulation for its approximate solution. The abstraction brought on by this selection mechanism separates the challenges specific to datasets and reconstruction objectives from the standard SfM pipeline and improves its generalization. This paper mainly focuses on application of this framework with standard SfM pipeline for accurate and ghost-free reconstructions of highly ambiguous datasets.

To demystify the trade-offs between robustness and accuracy, in this paper we thoroughly benchmark 18 ImageNet models using multiple robustness metrics, including the distortion, success rate and transferability of adversarial examples between 306 pairs of models. Our extensive experimental results reveal several new insights: (1) linear scaling law - the empirical $ell_2$ and $ell_infty$ distortion metrics scale linearly with the $log$ value of classification error; (2) model architecture is a more critical factor to robustness than model size, and the disclosed accuracy-robustness Pareto frontier can be used as an evaluation criterion for ImageNet model designers; (3) for a similar network architecture, increasing network depth slightly improves robustness in $ell_infty$ distortion; (4) there exist models (in VGG family) that exhibit high adversarial transferability, while most adversarial examples crafted from one model can only be transferred within the same family.

		"abstract": "We present a new computational model for gaze prediction in egocentric videos by exploring patterns in temporal shift of gaze fixations (attention transition) that are dependent on egocentric manipulation tasks. Our assumption is that the high-level context of how a task is completed in a certain way has a strong influence on attention transition and should be modeled for gaze prediction in natural dynamic scenes. Specifically, we propose a hybrid model based on deep neural networks which integrates task-dependent attention transition with bottom-up saliency prediction. In particular, the task-dependent attention transition is learned with a recurrent neural network to exploit the temporal context of gaze fixations, e.g., looking at a cup after moving gaze away from a grasped bottle. Experiments on public egocentric activity datasets show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art gaze prediction methods and is able to learn meaningful transition of human attention.",

		"title": "Joint Learning of Intrinsic Images and Semantic Segmentation",
		"abstract": "Semantic segmentation of outdoor scenes is problematic when there are variations in imaging conditions. It is known that albedo (reflectance) is invariant to all kinds of illumination effects. Thus, using reflectance images for semantic segmentation task can be favorable. Additionally, not only segmentation may benefit from reflectance, but also segmentation may be useful for reflectance computation. Therefore, in this paper, the tasks of semantic segmentation and intrinsic image decomposition are considered as a combined process by exploring their mutual relationship in a joint fashion. To that end, we propose a supervised end-to-end CNN architecture to jointly learn intrinsic image decomposition and semantic segmentation. We analyze the gains of addressing those two problems jointly. Moreover, new cascade CNN architectures for intrinsic-for-segmentation and segmentation-for-intrinsic are proposed as single tasks. Furthermore, a dataset of 35K synthetic images of natural environments is created with corresponding albedo and shading (intrinsics), as well as semantic labels (segmentation) assigned to each object/scene. The experiments show that joint learning of intrinsic image decomposition and semantic segmentation is beneficial for both tasks for natural scenes.

		"title": "Towards Robust Neural Networks via Random Self-ensemble",
		"abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of deep neural networks - A small adversarial perturbation that is imperceptible to human can easily make a well-trained deep neural network misclassify. This makes it unsafe to apply neural networks in security-critical applications. In this paper, we propose a new defense algorithm called Random Self-Ensemble (RSE) by combining two important concepts: {\bf randomness} and {\bf ensemble}. To protect a targeted model, RSE adds random noise layers to the neural network to prevent the strong gradient-based attacks, and ensembles the prediction over random noises to stabilize the performance. We show that our algorithm is equivalent to ensemble an infinite number of noisy models $f_epsilon$ without any additional memory overhead, and the proposed training procedure based on noisy stochastic gradient descent can ensure the ensemble model has a good predictive capability. Our algorithm significantly outperforms previous defense techniques on real data sets. For instance, on CIFAR-10 with VGG network (which has 92% accuracy without any attack), under the strong C&W attack within a certain distortion tolerance, the accuracy of unprotected model drops to less than 10%, the best previous defense technique has $48%$ accuracy, while our method still has $86%$ prediction accuracy under the same level of attack. Finally, our method is simple and easy to integrate into any neural network.",

We introduce a novel device that monitors the presence of objects on a virtual shell near the device, which we refer to as a light curtain. Light curtains offer a light-weight, resource-efficient and programmable approach to proximity awareness for obstacle avoidance and navigation. They also have additional benefits in terms of improving visibility in fog as well as flexibility in handling light fall-off. Our prototype for generating light curtains works by rapidly rotating a line sensor and a line laser, in synchrony. The device is capable of generating light curtains of various shapes with a range of 20-30m in sunlight (40m under cloudy skies and 50m indoors) and adapts dynamically to the demands of the task. We analyze properties of light curtains and various approaches to optimize their thickness as well as power requirements.

Meeting such challenges calls for new techniques that can effectively retrieve videos with natural language queries. Existing methods along this line, which mostly rely on embedding videos as a whole, remain far from satisfactory for real-world applications due to the limited expressive power. In this work, we aim to move beyond this limitation by delving into the internal structures of both sides, the queries and the videos. Specifically, we propose a new framework called Find and Focus (FIFO), which not only performs top-level matching (paragraph vs. video), but also makes part-level associations, localizing a video clip for each sentence in the query with the help of a focusing guide. These levels are complementary - the top-level matching narrows the search while the part-level localization refines the results.

In our work, we rethink this choice and study an alternative formulation, namely using two-dimensional maps to encode latent states and convolution for state transformation. This is motivated by the curiosity about a question: how are the spatial structures in the latent states related to the resultant captions? Our study on MSCOCO [1] and Flickr30k [2] leads to two significant observations. First, the formulation with 2D states is generally more effective in captioning, consistently achieving higher performance with comparable parameter sizes. Second, 2D states preserve spatial locality. Taking advantage of this, we derive a simple scheme that can visually reveal the internal dynamics in the process of caption generation, as well as the connections between input visual domain and output linguistic domain.",

Instead, an idealized model would preserve a meaningful representation of the voxelized object, while explaining the pose-difference between the two inputs. An equivariant representation vector has two components: the invariant identity part, and a discernable encoding of the transformation. Models that can't explain pose-differences risk ``diluting'' the representation, in pursuit of optimizing a classification or regression loss function. We introduce a Group Convolutional Neural Network with linear equivariance to translations and right angle rotations in three dimensions. We call this network CubeNet, reflecting its cube-like symmetry. By construction, this network helps preserve a 3D shape's global and local signature, as it is transformed through successive layers. We apply this network to a variety of 3D inference problems, achieving state-of-the-art on the ModelNet10 classification challenge, and comparable performance on the ISBI 2012 Connectome Segmentation Benchmark.

Global shape deformations are recovered from a subspace model learned from 3D data of clothed people in motion, while high frequency details are added to normal maps created using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network whose architecture is designed to enforce realism and temporal consistency. This leads to unprecedented high-quality rendering of clothing deformation sequences, where fine wrinkles from (real) high resolution observations can be recovered. In addition, as the model is learned independently from body shape and pose, the framework is suitable for applications that require retargeting (e.g., body animation). Our experiments show original high quality results with a flexible model. We claim an entirely data-driven approach to realistic cloth wrinkle generation is possible.",

Second, we develop a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BFPN) to aggregate shadow contexts spanned across different CNN layers by deploying two series of RAR modules in the network to iteratively combine and refine context features: one series to refine context features from deep to shallow layers, and another series from shallow to deep layers. Hence, we can better suppress false detections and enhance shadow details at the same time. We evaluate our network on two common shadow detection benchmark datasets: SBU and UCF.

As a second, smaller contribution, we also show that when using such a proximal reconstruction framework, it is beneficial to employ the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART) instead of the commonly used Conjugate Gradient (CG) method in the solution of the data term proximal operator. We show empirically that CG often does not converge to the global optimum for tomography problem even though the underlying problem is convex.

Our graph-partitioning-based clustering algorithm allows us to consider the relationships between all salient instances in the training set as well as the information within them.

		"abstract": "In current face recognition approaches with convolutional neural network (CNN), a pair of faces to compare are independently fed into the CNN for feature extraction. For both faces the same kernels are applied and hence the representation of a face stays fixed regardless of who it is compared with. As for us humans, however, one generally focuses on varied characteristics of a face when comparing it with distinct persons. Inspired, we propose a novel CNN structure with what we referred to as contrastive convolution, which specifically focuses on the distinct characteristics between the two faces to compare, i.e., those contrastive characteristics. Extensive experiments on the challenging LFW, and IJB-A show that our proposed contrastive convolution significantly improves the vanilla CNN and achieves quite promising performance in face verification task.",

Successfully attacking face detectors could be a serious malware vulnerability when deploying a smart surveillance system utilizing face detectors. In addition, for the privacy concern, it helps prevent faces being harvested and stored in the server. We show that existing adversarial perturbation methods are not effective to perform such an at- tack, especially when there are multiple faces in the input image. This is because the adversarial perturbation specically generated for one face may disrupt the adversarial perturbation for another face. In this paper, we call this problem the Instance Perturbation Interference (IPI) problem. This IPI problem is addressed by studying the relationship between the deep neural network receptive eld and the adversarial perturbation. As such, we propose the Localized Instance Perturbation (LIP) that confines the adversarial perturbation inside the Effective Receptive Field (ERF) of a target to perform the attack. Experimental results show the LIP method massively outperforms existing adversarial perturbation generation methods - often by a factor of 2 to 10.",

The proposed framework explicitly learns a degradation transform for the original video inputs, in order to optimize the trade-off between target task performance and the associated privacy budgets on the degraded video. A notable challenge is that the privacy budget, often defined and measured in task-driven contexts, cannot be reliably indicated using any single model performance, because a strong protection of privacy has to sustain against any possible model that tries to hack privacy information. Such an uncommon situation has motivated us to propose two strategies to enhance the generalization of the learned degradation on protecting privacy against unseen hacker models. Novel training strategies and evaluation protocols have been designed accordingly. Two experiments on privacy-preserving action recognition, with privacy budgets defined in various ways, manifest the compelling effectiveness of the proposed framework in simultaneously maintaining high target task (action recognition) performance while suppressing the privacy breach risk.",

However, most models are both computation and memory intensive, which arouse the interest of network compression. While existing compression methods achieve good performance, they suffer from three limitations: 1) the inevitable retraining with enormous labeled data; 2) the massive GPU hours for retraining; 3) the training tricks for model compression. Especially the requirement of retraining on original datasets makes it difficult to apply in many real-world scenarios, where training data is not publicly available. In this paper, we reveal that re-normalization is the practical and effective way to alleviate the above limitations. Through quantization or pruning, most methods may compress a large number of parameters but ignore the core role in performance degradation, which is the Gaussian conjugate prior induced by batch normalization. By employing the re-estimated statistics in batch normalization, we significantly improve the accuracy of compressed CNNs. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show it outperforms baselines by a large margin and is comparable to label-based methods. Besides, the fine-tuning process takes less than 5 minutes on CPU, using 1000 unlabeled images.",

Specifically, we establish a large-scale eye-tracking database of videos (LEDOV), which includes 32 subjects' fixations on 538 videos. We find from LEDOV that human attention is more likely to be attracted by objects, particularly the moving objects or the moving parts of objects. Hence, an object-to-motion convolutional neural network (OM-CNN) is developed to predict the intra-frame saliency for DeepVS, which is composed of the objectness and motion subnets. In OM-CNN, cross-net mask and hierarchical feature normalization are proposed to combine the spatial features of the objectness subnet and the temporal features of the motion subnet. We further find from our database that there exists a temporal correlation of human attention with a smooth saliency transition across video frames. We thus propose saliency-structured convolutional long short-term memory (SS-ConvLSTM) network, using the extracted features from OM-CNN as the input. Consequently, the inter-frame saliency maps of a video can be generated, which consider both structured output with center-bias and cross-frame transitions of human attention maps. Finally, the experimental results show that DeepVS advances the state-of-the-art in video saliency prediction.",

Specifically, rather than using the conventional Euclidean loss, we propose a novel frame-wise geodesic loss as a geometrically meaningful, more precise distance measurement. Moreover, inspired by the adversarial training mechanism, we present a new learning procedure to simultaneously validate the sequence-level plausibility of the prediction and its coherence with the input sequence by introducing two global recurrent discriminators.

In spite of its nice property of interpretability, the method is slow. We propose a variant of archetypal analysis which scales gracefully to large datasets. The core idea is to decouple the binding between data and archetypes and require them to be unit normalized. Geometrically, the method learns a convex hull inside the unit sphere and represents the data by their projections on the closest surfaces of the convex hull. By minimizing the representation error, the method pushes the convex hull surfaces close to the regions of the sphere where the data reside. The vertices of the convex hull are the learned archetypes. We apply the method to human faces and poses to validate its effectiveness in the context of reconstructions and classifications.",

		"abstract": "Shallow Depth-of-Field (DoF) is a desirable effect in photography which renders artistic photos. Usually, it requires single-lens reflex cameras and certain photography skills to generate such effects. Recently, dual-lens on cellphones is used to estimate scene depth and simulate DoF effects for portrait shots. However, this technique cannot be applied to photos already taken and does not work well for whole-body scenes where the subject is at a distance from the cameras. In this work, we introduce an automatic system that achieves portrait DoF rendering for monocular cameras. Specifically, we first exploit Convolutional Neural Networks to estimate the relative depth and portrait segmentation maps from a single input image. Since these initial estimates from a single input are usually coarse and lack fine details, we further learn pixel affinities to refine the coarse estimation maps. With the refined estimation, we conduct depth and segmentation-aware blur rendering to the input image with a Conditional Random Field and image matting. In addition, we train a spatially-variant Recursive Neural Network to learn and accelerate this rendering process. We show that the proposed algorithm can effectively generate portraitures with realistic DoF effects using one single input.

However, this common approach fails to separate the attributes observed during training from the objects with which they are composed, making it ineffectual when encountering new attribute-object compositions. Instead, we propose to model attributes as operators. Our approach learns a semantic embedding that explicitly factors out attributes from their accompanying objects, and also benefits from novel regularizers expressing attribute operators’ effects (e.g., blunt should undo the effects of sharp). Not only does our approach align conceptually with the linguistic role of attributes as modifiers, but it also generalizes to recognize unseen compositions of objects and attributes, We validate our approach on two challenging datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show that not only can our model recognize unseen compositions robustly in an open-world setting, it can also generalize to compositions where objects themselves were unseen during training.",

		"abstract": "Humans can learn in a continuous manner. Old rarely utilized knowledge can be overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used knowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems, lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over tasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that, given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb’s rule, which is a model for the learning process in the brain. We test our method on a sequence of object recognition tasks and on the challenging problem of learning an embedding for predicting triplets.

The underlying algorithms used by AF systems, such as contrast detection and phase differencing, are well established. However, determining a high-level objective regarding how to best focus a particular scene is less clear. This is evident in part by the fact that different smartphone cameras employ different AF criteria; for example, some attempt to keep items in the center in focus, others give priority to faces while others maximize the sharpness of the entire scene. The fact that different objectives exist raises the research question of whether there is a preferred objective. This becomes more interesting when AF is applied to videos of dynamic scenes. The work in this paper aims to revisit AF for smartphones within the context of temporal image data. As part of this effort, we describe the capture of a new 4D dataset that provides access to a full focal stack at each time point in a temporal sequence. Based on this dataset, we have developed a platform and associated application programming interface (API) that mimic real AF systems, restricting lens motion within the constraints of a dynamic environment and frame capture. Using our platform we evaluated several high-level focusing objectives and found interesting insight into what users prefer.

First, our approach transfers knowledge in all the convolutional layers through attention alignment. Most previous methods align high-level representations, e.g., activations of the fully connected (FC) layer. In these methods, however, the convolutional layers which underpin critical low-level domain knowledge cannot be updated directly towards reducing domain discrepancy. Specifically, we assume that the discriminative regions in an image are relatively invariant to image style changes. Based on this assumption, we propose an attention alignment scheme on all the target convolutional layers to uncover the knowledge shared by the source domain. Second, we estimate the posterior label distribution of the unlabeled data for target network training. Previous methods, which iteratively update the pseudo labels by the target network and refine the target network by the updated pseudo labels, are vulnerable to label estimation errors. Instead, our approach uses category distribution to calculate the cross-entropy loss for training, thereby ameliorating the error accumulation of the estimated labels.

		"abstract": "Learned 3D representations of human faces are useful for computer vision problems such as 3D face tracking and reconstruction from images, as well as graphics applications such as character generation and animation. Traditional models learn a latent representation of a face using linear subspaces or higher-order tensor generalizations. Due to this linearity, they can not capture extreme deformations and non-linear expressions. To address this, we introduce a versatile model that learns a non-linear representation of a face using spectral convolutions on a mesh surface. We introduce mesh sampling operations that enable a hierarchical mesh representation that captures non-linear variations in shape and expression at multiple scales within the model. In a variational setting, our model samples diverse realistic 3D faces from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Our training data consists of 20,466 meshes of extreme expressions captured over 12 different subjects. Despite limited training data, our trained model outperforms state-of-the-art face models with 50% lower reconstruction error, while using 75% fewer parameters. We also show that, replacing the expression space of an existing state-of-the-art face model with our autoencoder, achieves a lower reconstruction error.

		"abstract": "Reconstructing 3D facial geometry from a single RGB image has recently instigated wide research interest. However, it is still an ill-posed problem and most methods rely on prior models hence undermining the accuracy of the recovered 3D faces. In this paper, we exploit the Epipolar Plane Images (EPI) obtained from light field cameras and learn CNN models that recover horizontal and vertical 3D facial curves from the respective horizontal and vertical EPIs. Our 3D face reconstruction network (FaceLFnet) comprises a densely connected architecture to learn accurate 3D facial curves from low resolution EPIs. To train the proposed FaceLFnets from scratch, we synthesize photo-realistic light field images from 3D facial scans. The curve by curve 3D face estimation approach allows the networks to learn from only 14K images of 80 identities, which still comprises over 11 Million EPIs/curves. The estimated facial curves are merged into a single pointcloud to which a surface is fitted to get the final 3D face. Our method is model-free, requires only a few training samples to learn FaceLFnet and can reconstruct 3D faces with high accuracy from single light field images under varying poses, expressions and lighting conditions. Comparison on the BU-3DFE and BU-4DFE datasets show that our method reduces reconstruction errors by over 20% compared to recent state of the art.",

		"abstract": "Due to the rapid growth of multi-modal data, hashing methods for cross-modal retrieval have received considerable attention. However, finding content similarities between different modalities of data is still challenging due to an existing heterogeneity gap. To further address this problem, we propose an adversarial hashing network with an attention mechanism to enhance the measurement of content similarities by selectively focusing on the informative parts of multi-modal data. The proposed new deep adversarial network consists of three building blocks: 1) the feature learning module to obtain the feature representations; 2) the attention module to generate an attention mask, which is used to divide the feature representations into the attended and unattended feature representations; and 3) the hashing module to learn hash functions that preserve the similarities between different modalities. In our framework, the attention and hashing modules are trained in an adversarial way: the attention module attempts to make the hashing module unable to preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. the unattended feature representations, while the hashing module aims to preserve the similarities of multi-modal data w.r.t. the attended and unattended feature representations. Extensive evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method brings substantial improvements over other state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.",

The goal of Open MIC is to stimulate research in domain adaptation, egocentric recognition and few-shot learning by providing a testbed complementary to the famous Office dataset which reaches ~90% accuracy. To form our dataset, we captured a number of images per art piece with a mobile phone and wearable cameras to form the source and target data splits, respectively. To achieve robust baselines, we build on a recent approach that aligns per-class scatter matrices of the source and target CNN streams. Moreover, we exploit the positive definite nature of such representations by using end-to-end Bregman divergences and the Riemannian metric. We present baselines such as training/evaluation per exhibition and training/evaluation on the combined set covering 866 exhibit identities.

In computer vision, however, there has been relatively little exploration of hard attention, where some information is selectively ignored, in spite of the success of soft attention, where information is re-weighted and aggregated, but never filtered out. Here, we introduce a new approach for hard attention and find it achieves very competitive performance on a recently-released visual question answering dataset, equalling and in some cases surpassing similar soft attention architectures while entirely ignoring some features. Even though the hard attention mechanism is not differentiable, we found that the feature magnitudes correlate with semantic relevance, and provided a useful signal for our mechanism's attentional selection criterion. Because hard attention selects important features of the input information, it can also be more efficient than analogous soft attention mechanisms. This is especially important for recent approaches that use non-local pairwise operations, whereby computational and memory costs are quadratic in the size of the set of features.",

In particular, multi-scale shared features are learned firstly, and high-level features of face alignment are fed into AU detection. Moreover, to extract precise local features, we propose an adaptive attention learning module to refine the attention map of each AU adaptively.

How can we design a compact and effective network without massive experiments and expert knowledge? In this paper, we propose a simple and effective framework to learn and prune deep models in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a new type of parameter -- scaling factor is first introduced to scale the outputs of specific structures, such as neurons, groups or residual blocks. Then we add sparsity regularizations on these factors, and solve this optimization problem by a modified stochastic Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method. By forcing some of the factors to zero, we can safely remove the corresponding structures, thus prune the unimportant parts of a CNN. Comparing with other structure selection methods that may need thousands of trials or iterative fine-tuning, our method is trained fully end-to-end in one training pass without bells and whistles.

The vast majority of prior work for this problem focus on how to increase the resolution of low-resolution images which are artificially generated by simple bilinear down-sampling (or in a few cases by blurring followed by down-sampling). We show that such methods fail to produce good results when applied to real-world low-resolution, low quality images. To circumvent this problem, we propose a two-stage process which firstly trains a High-to-Low Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to learn how to degrade and downsample high-resolution images requiring, during training, only extit{unpaired} high and low-resolution images. Once this is achieved, the output of this network is used to train a Low-to-High GAN for image super-resolution using this time extit{paired} low- and high-resolution images.

		"title": "Self-Supervised Relative Depth Learning for Urban Scene Understanding",
		"abstract": "As an agent moves through the world, the apparent motion of scene elements is (usually) inversely proportional to their depth. It is natural for a learning agent to associate image patterns with the magnitude of their displacement over time: as the agent moves, faraway mountains don't move much; nearby trees move a lot. This natural relationship between the appearance of objects and their motion is a rich source of information about the world. In this work, we start by training a deep network, using fully automatic supervision, to predict relative scene depth from single images. The relative depth training images are automatically derived from simple videos of cars moving through a scene, using recent motion segmentation techniques, and no human-provided labels. This proxy task of predicting relative depth from a single image induces features in the network that result in large improvements in a set of downstream tasks including semantic segmentation, joint road segmentation and car detection, and monocular (absolute) depth estimation, over a network trained from scratch. The improvement on the semantic segmentation task is greater than those produced by any other automatically supervised methods. Moreover, for monocular depth estimation, our unsupervised pre-training method even outperforms supervised pre-training with ImageNet. In addition, we demonstrate benefits from learning to predict (again, completely unsupervised) relative depth in the specific videos associated with various downstream tasks (e.g., KITTI). We adapt to the specific scenes in those tasks in an unsupervised manner to improve performance. In summary, for semantic segmentation, we present state-of-the-art results among methods that do not use supervised pre-training, and we even exceed the performance of supervised ImageNet pre-trained models for monocular depth estimation, achieving results that are comparable with state-of-the-art methods.",

To investigate the effective features for face recognition, we propose a novel face recognition method, called a pairwise relational network (PRN), that obtains local appearance patches around landmark points on the feature map, and captures the pairwise relation between a pair of local appearance patches. The PRN is trained to capture unique and discriminative pairwise relations among different identities. Because the existence and meaning of pairwise relations should be identity dependent, we add a face identity state feature, which obtains from the long short-term memory (LSTM) units network with the sequential local appearance patches on the feature maps, to the PRN. To further improve accuracy of face recognition, we combined the global appearance representation with the pairwise relational feature. Experimental results on the LFW show that the PRN using only pairwise relations achieved 99.65% accuracy and the PRN using both pairwise relations and face identity state feature achieved 99.76% accuracy. On the YTF, both the PRN using only pairwise relations and the PRN using pairwise relations and the face identity state feature achieved the state-of-the-art (95.7% and 96.3%).

For better recovery of fine facial details, we modify the problem setting by taking both the degraded observation and a high-quality guided image of the same identity as input to our guided face restoration network (GFRNet). However, the degraded observation and guided image generally are different in pose, illumination and expression, thereby making plain CNNs (e.g., U-Net) fail to recover fine and identity-aware facial details. To tackle this issue, our GFRNet model includes both a warping subnetwork (WarpNet) and a reconstruction subnetwork (RecNet). The WarpNet is introduced to predict flow field for warping the guided image to correct pose and expression (i.e., warped guidance), while the RecNet takes the degraded observation and warped guidance as input to produce the restoration result. Due to that the ground-truth flow field is unavailable, landmark loss together with total variation regularization are incorporated to guide the learning of WarpNet. Furthermore, to make the model applicable to blind restoration, our GFRNet is trained on the synthetic data with versatile settings on blur kernel, noise level, downsampling scale factor, and JPEG quality factor. Experiments show that our GFRNet not only performs favorably against the state-of-the-art image and face restoration methods, but also generates visually photo-realistic results on real degraded facial images.",

Our approach is based on the principles of cross-validation, where a validation set is used to limit the model overfitting. We formulate such principles as a bilevel optimization problem. This formulation allows us to define the optimization of a cost on the validation set subject to another optimization on the training set. The overfitting is controlled by introducing weights on each mini-batch in the training set and by choosing their values so that they minimize the error on the validation set. In practice, these weights define mini-batch learning rates in a gradient descent update equation that favor gradients with better generalization capabilities. Because of its simplicity, this approach can be integrated with other regularization methods and training schemes.

		"title": "Sparsely Aggregated Convolutional Networks",
		"abstract": "We explore a key architectural aspect of deep convolutional neural networks: the pattern of internal skip connections used to aggregate outputs of earlier layers for consumption by deeper layers. Such aggregation is critical to facilitate training of very deep networks in an end-to-end manner. This is a primary reason for the widespread adoption of residual networks, which aggregate outputs via cumulative summation. While subsequent works investigate alternative aggregation operations (eg~concatenation), we focus on an orthogonal question: which outputs to aggregate at a particular point in the network. We propose a new internal connection structure which aggregates only a sparse set of previous outputs at any given depth. Our experiments demonstrate this simple design change offers superior performance with fewer parameters and lower computational requirements. Moreover, we show that sparse aggregation allows networks to scale more robustly to 1000+ layers, thereby opening future avenues for training long-running visual processes.",

		"abstract": "Humans have a remarkable ability to use physical commonsense and predict the effect of collisions. But do they understand the underlying factors? Can they predict if the underlying factors have changed? Interestingly, in most cases humans can predict the effects of similar collisions with different conditions such as changes in mass, friction, etc. It is postulated this is primarily because we learn to model physics with meaningful latent variables. This does not imply we can estimate the precise values of these meaningful variables (estimate exact values of mass or friction). Inspired by this observation, we propose an interpretable intuitive physics model where specific dimensions in the bottleneck layers correspond to different physical properties. In order to demonstrate that our system models these underlying physical properties, we train our model on collisions of different shapes (cube, cone, cylinder, spheres etc.) and test on collisions of unseen combinations of shapes. Furthermore, we demonstrate our model generalizes well even when similar scenes are simulated with different underlying properties.",

However, learning the highly complex regression between eye images and gaze directions is nontrivial, and thus the problem is yet to be solved efficiently. In this paper, we propose the Asymmetric Regression-Evaluation Network (ARE-Net), and try to improve the gaze estimation performance to its full extent. At the core of our method is the notion of ``two eye asymmetry'' observed during gaze estimation for the left and right eyes. Inspired by this, we design the multi-stream ARE-Net; one asymmetric regression network (AR-Net) predicts 3D gaze directions for both eyes with a novel asymmetric strategy, and the evaluation network (E-Net) adaptively adjusts the strategy by evaluating the two eyes in terms of their performance during optimization. By training the whole network, our method achieves promising results and surpasses the state-of-the-art methods on multiple public datasets.",

		"title": "Toward Characteristic-Preserving Image-based Virtual Try-On Network",
		"abstract": "Image-based virtual try-on systems for fitting new in-shop clothes into a person image have attracted increasing research attention, yet is still challenging. A desirable pipeline should not only transform the target clothes into the most fitting shape seamlessly but also preserve well the clothes identity in the generated image, that is, the key characteristics (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) that depict the original clothes. However, previous image-conditioned generation works fail to meet these critical requirements towards the plausible virtual try-on performance since they fail to handle large spatial misalignment between the input image and target clothes. Prior work explicitly tackled spatial deformation using shape context matching, but failed to preserve clothing details due to its coarse-to-fine strategy. In this work, we propose a new fully-learnable Characteristic-Preserving Virtual Try-On Network(CP-VTON) for addressing all real-world challenges in this task. First, CP-VTON learns a thin-plate spline transformation for transforming the in-shop clothes into fitting the body shape of the target person via a new Geometric Matching Module (GMM) rather than computing correspondences of interest points as prior works did. Second, to alleviate boundary artifacts of warped clothes and make the results more realistic, we employ a Try-On Module that learns a composition mask to integrate the warped clothes and the rendered image to ensure smoothness. Extensive experiments on a fashion dataset demonstrate our CP-VTON achieves the state-of-the-art virtual try-on performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

Towards this goal, we develop analysis and a training methodology for autoencoding models, whose encoded features aim to disentangle attributes. These features are explicitly split into two components: one that should represent attributes in common between pairs of images, and another that should represent attributes that change between pairs of images. We show that achieving this objective faces two main challenges: One is that the model may learn degenerate mappings, which we call shortcut problem, and the other is that the attribute representation for an image is not guaranteed to follow the same interpretation on another image, which we call reference ambiguity. To address the shortcut problem, we introduce novel constraints on image pairs and triplets and show their effectiveness both analytically and experimentally. In the case of the reference ambiguity, we formally prove that a model that guarantees an ideal feature separation cannot be built. We validate our findings on several datasets and show that, surprisingly, trained neural networks often do not exhibit the reference ambiguity.",

While being efficient, the classification accuracy of the current 1-bit CNNs is much worse compared with their counterpart real-valued CNN models on the large-scale dataset, like ImageNet. To shrink the performance gap between the 1-bit and real-valued CNN models, we propose a novel model, dubbed Bi-Real net, which connects the real activations (after the 1-bit convolution and/or BatchNorm layer, before the sign function) to that of the consecutive block, through an identity shortcut. Consequently, compared to the standard 1-bit CNN, the representational capability of the Bi-Real net is significantly enhanced, only with a negligible additional cost on computation. Moreover, we develop a specific training algorithm including three technical novelties for 1-bit CNNs. First, we derive a tight approximation to the derivative of the non-differentiable sign function with respect to activation. Second, we propose a magnitude-aware gradient with respect to weight to update the weight parameter. Last, we pre-train the real-valued CNN model with a clip function, rather than the ReLU function, to provide a better initialization for Bi-Real net. Experiments on ImageNet show that the Bi-Real net with proposed training algorithm achieves 56.4% and 62.2% top-1 accuracy with 18 layers and 34 layers, respectively, and achieves up to 23.9X memory saving and 17.0X computational reduction.",

Previous work has succeeded in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to style transfer for monocular images or videos. However, style transfer for stereoscopic images is still a missing piece. Different from processing a monocular image, the two views of a stylized stereoscopic pair are required to be consistent to provide observers a comfortable visual experience. In this paper, we propose a novel dual path network for view-consistent style transfer on stereoscopic images. While each view of the stereoscopic pair is processed in an individual path, a novel feature aggregation strategy is proposed to effectively share information between the two paths. Besides a traditional perceptual loss being used for controlling the style transfer quality in each view, a multi-layer view loss is leveraged to enforce the network to coordinate the learning of both the paths to generate view-consistent stylized results. Extensive experiments show that, compared against previous methods, our proposed model can produce stylized stereoscopic images which achieve decent view consistency.",

We find that neural networks can learn to use invisible perturbations to encode a rich amount of useful information. In fact, one can exploit this capability for the task of data hiding. We jointly train encoder and decoder networks, where given an input message and cover image, the encoder produces a visually indistinguishable encoded image, from which the decoder can recover the original message. We show that these encodings are competitive with existing data hiding algorithms, and further that they can be made robust to noise: our models learn to reconstruct hidden information in an encoded image despite the presence of Gaussian blurring, pixelwise dropout, cropping, and JPEG compression. Even though JPEG is non-differentiable, we show that a robust model can be trained using differentaible approximations.

Both feature learning and prediction modeling have been investigated to tackle the problem. Though effective, most existing discriminative methods yield a single deterministic estimation of target poses. Due to their single-value mapping intrinsic, they fail to adequately handle self-occlusion problems, where occluded joints present multiple modes. In this paper, we tackle the self-occlusion issue and provide a complete description of observed poses given an input depth image by a novel method called hierarchical mixture density networks (HMDN). The proposed method leverages the state-of-the-art hand pose estimators based on Convolutional Neural Networks to facilitate feature learning, while it models the multiple modes in a two-level hierarchy to reconcile single-valued and multi-valued mapping in its output. The whole framework with a mixture of two differentiable density functions is naturally end-to-end trainable.

Once the prior is learned in a supervised fashion, one can easily learn the full map to infer optical flow directly from two or more images, without any need for (additional) supervision. We introduce a novel architecture, called Conditional Prior Network (CPN), and show how to train it to yield a conditional prior. When used in conjunction with a simple optical flow architecture, the CPN beats all variational method and all unsupervised learning-based ones.

Specifically, we leverage a triplet network to perform deep metric learning, which takes a set of triplets as input, and a newly designed triplet loss function is minimized to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs of keypoints.

		"abstract": "We propose a novel end-to-end semi-supervised adversarial framework to generate photorealistic face images of new identities with a wide range of expressions, poses, and illuminations conditioned by synthetic images sampled from a 3D morphable model. Previous adversarial style-transfer methods either supervise their networks with a large volume of paired data or train highly under-constrained two-way generative networks in an unsupervised fashion. We propose a semi-supervised adversarial learning framework to constrain the two-way networks by a small number of paired real and synthetic images, along with a large volume of unpaired data. A set-based loss is also proposed to preserve identity coherence of generated images. Qualitative results show that generated face images of new identities contain pose, lighting and expression diversity. They are also highly constrained by the synthetic input images while adding photorealism and retaining identity information. We combine face images generated by the proposed method with a real data set to train face recognition algorithms and evaluate the model quantitatively on two challenging data sets: LFW and IJB-A. The generated images by our framework consistently improve the performance of deep face recognition networks trained with the Oxford VGG Face dataset, and achieve comparable results to the state-of-the-art.",

Recent advancements in binarized networks have demonstrated progress on reducing computational and memory costs, however, they suffer from significant performance degradation comparing to their full-precision counterparts. Thus, a highly-economical yet effective CNN that is authentically applicable to consumer electronics is at urgent need. In this work, we propose a Ternary-Binary Network (TBN), which provides an efficient approximation to standard CNNs. Based on an accelerated ternary-binary matrix multiplication, TBN replaces the arithmetical operations in standard CNNs with efficient XOR, AND and bitcount operations, and thus provides an optimal tradeoff between memory, efficiency and performance. TBN demonstrates its consistent effectiveness when applied to various CNN architectures (e.g., AlexNet and ResNet) on multiple datasets of different scales, and provides ~32x memory savings and 40x faster convolutional operations. Meanwhile, TBN can outperform XNOR-Network by up to 5.5% (top-1 accuracy) on the ImageNet classification task, and up to 4.4% (mAP score) on the PASCAL VOC object detection task.",

This paper presents a novel image synthesis technique that aims to generate a large amount of annotated scene text images for training accurate and robust scene text detection and recognition models. The proposed technique consists of three innovative designs. First, it realizes \"semantic coherent\" synthesis by embedding texts at semantically sensible regions within the background image, where the semantic coherence is achieved by leveraging the semantic annotations of objects and image regions that have been created in the prior semantic segmentation research. Second, it exploits visual saliency to determine the embedding locations within each semantic sensible region, which coincides with the fact that texts are often placed around homogeneous regions for better visibility in scenes. Third, it designs an adaptive text appearance model that determines the color and brightness of embedded texts by learning from the feature of real scene text images adaptively. The proposed technique has been evaluated over five public datasets and the experiments show its superior performance in training accurate and robust scene text detection and recognition models.",

In this paper, we introduce an interaction-aware method for boundary-based image segmentation. Instead of relying on pre-defined low-level image features, our method adaptively predicts object boundaries according to image content and user interactions. Therein, we develop a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network that takes both the image and user interactions (e.g. clicks on boundary points) as input and predicts semantically meaningful boundaries that match user intentions. Our method explicitly models the dependency of boundary extraction results on image content and user interactions.

These approaches are less desirable in practice, as ground truth intrinsic images are extremely difficult to acquire, and requirement of multiple images pose severe limitation on applicable scenarios. In this paper, we propose to bring the best of both worlds. We present a two stream convolutional neural network framework that is capable of learning the decomposition effectively in the absence of any ground truth intrinsic images, and can be easily extended to a (semi-)supervised setup. At inference time, our model can be easily reduced to a single stream module that performs intrinsic decomposition on a single input image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experimental study on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior performance over previous approaches in both single-image and multi-image settings.

We first model the annotation of complementary labels via transition probabilities $P(\bar{Y}=i|Y=j), i eq jin{1,cdots,c}$, where $c$ is the number of classes. Previous methods implicitly assume that $P(\bar{Y}=i|Y=j), forall i eq j$, are identical, which is not true in practice because humans are biased toward their own experience. For example, as shown in Figure ef{complementary_label_cases}, if an annotator is more familiar with monkeys than prairie dogs when providing complementary labels for meerkats, she is more likely to employ ``monkey'' as a complementary label. We therefore reason that the transition probabilities will be different. In this paper, we propose a framework that contributes three main innovations to learning with extbf{biased} complementary labels: (1) It estimates transition probabilities with no bias. (2) It provides a general method to modify traditional loss functions and extends standard deep neural network classifiers to learn with biased complementary labels.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are used as a means of encoding/decoding frames into/from the latent space and RNN as a way to model the dynamics in the latent space. We improve the video generation consistency through temporally-conditional sampling and quality by structuring the latent space with attribute controls; ensuring that attributes can be both inferred and conditioned on during learning/generation. As a result, given attributes and/or the first frame, our model is able to generate diverse but highly consistent sets of video sequences, accounting for the inherent uncertainty in the prediction task. Experimental results on three challenging datasets, along with detailed comparison to the state-of-the-art, verify effectiveness of the framework.",

		"title": "Video Re-localization",
		"abstract": "Many methods have been developed to help people find the video content they want efficiently. However, there are still some unsolved problems in this area. For example, given a query video and a reference video, how to accurately localize a segment in the reference video such that the segment semantically corresponds to the query video? We define a distinctively new task, namely extbf{video re-localization}, to address this need. Video re-localization is an important enabling technology with many applications, such as fast seeking in videos, video copy detection, as well as video surveillance. Meanwhile, it is also a challenging research task because the visual appearance of a semantic concept in videos can have large variations. The first hurdle to clear for the video re-localization task is the lack of existing datasets. It is labor expensive to collect pairs of videos with semantic coherence or correspondence, and label the corresponding segments. We first exploit and reorganize the videos in ActivityNet to form a new dataset for video re-localization research, which consists of about 10,000 videos of diverse visual appearances associated with the localized boundary information. Subsequently, we propose an innovative cross gated bilinear matching model such that every time-step in the reference video is matched against the attentively weighted query video. Consequently, the prediction of the starting and ending time is formulated as a classification problem based on the matching results. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods.",

		"title": "Adversarial Open-World Person Re-Identification",
		"abstract": "In a typical real-world application of re-id, a watch-list (gallery set) of a handful of target people (e.g. suspects) to track around a large volume of non-target people are demanded across camera views, and this is called the open-world person re-id. Different from conventional (closed-world) person re-id, a large portion of probe samples are not from target people in the open-world setting. And, it always happens that a non-target person would look similar to a target one and therefore would seriously challenge a re-id system. In this work, we introduce a deep open-world group-based person re-id model based on adversarial learning to alleviate the attack problem caused by similar non-target people. The main idea is learning to attack feature extractor on the target people by using GAN to generate very target-like images (imposters), and in the meantime the model will make the feature extractor learn to tolerate the attack by discriminative learning so as to realize group-based verification. The framework we proposed is called the adversarial open-world person re-identification, and this is realized by our Adversarial PersonNet (APN) that jointly learns a generator, a person discriminator, a target discriminator and a feature extractor, where the feature extractor and target discriminator share the same weights so as to makes the feature extractor learn to tolerate the attack by imposters for better group-based verification. While open-world person re-id is challenging, we show for the first time that the adversarial-based approach helps stabilize person re-id system under imposter attack more effectively.",

In this paper, we establish a multiple-task learning framework to segment lane areas and detect lane boundaries simultaneously.

Our additional discriminator encourages the generator to produce structural high-frequency features rather than noisy artifacts as it distinguishes synthetic and real images in terms of features.

A stagewise approach is proposed to incorporate high confident object regions to learn the SPG masks. The high confident regions within attention maps are utilized to progressively learn the SPG masks. The masks are then used as an auxiliary pixel-level supervision to facilitate the training of classification networks. Extensive experiments on ILSVRC demonstrate that SPG is effective in producing high-quality object localizations maps.

Our algorithm regresses a velocity vector from the history of linear accelerations and angular velocities, then corrects low-frequency bias in the linear accelerations, which are integrated twice to estimate positions. We have acquired training data with ground-truth motions across multiple human subjects and multiple phone placements (e.g., in a bag or a hand-held). The qualitatively and quantitatively evaluations have demonstrated that our algorithm has surprisingly shown comparable results to full Visual Inertial navigation. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to integrate sophisticated machine learning techniques with inertial navigation, potentially opening up a new line of research in the domain of data-driven inertial navigation.

Typically, the goal of image dehazing is to produce clearer images from which human vision can better identify the object and structural details present in the images. When the ground-truth haze-free image is available for a hazy image, quantitative evaluation of image dehazing is usually based on objective metrics, such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM). However, in many applications, large-scale images are collected not for visual examination by human. Instead, they are used for many high-level vision tasks, such as automatic classification, recognition and categorization. One fundamental problem here is whether various dehazing methods can produce clearer images that can help improve the performance of the high-level tasks. In this paper, we empirically study this problem in the important task of image classification by using both synthetic and real hazy image datasets. From the experimental results, we find that the existing image-dehazing methods cannot improve much the image-classification performance and sometimes even reduce the image classification performance.",

		"abstract": "In generalized zero shot learning (GZSL), the set of classes are split into seen and unseen classes, where training relies on the semantic features of the seen and unseen classes and the visual representations of only the seen classes, while testing uses the visual representations of the seen and unseen classes. Current methods address GZSL by learning a transformation from the visual to the semantic space, exploring the assumption that the distribution of classes in the semantic and visual spaces is relatively similar. Such methods tend to transform unseen testing visual representations into one of the seen classes' semantic features instead of the semantic features of the correct unseen class, resulting in low accuracy GZSL classification. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been explored to synthesize visual representations of the unseen classes from their semantic features - the synthesized representations of the seen and unseen classes are then used to train the GZSL classifier. This approach has been shown to boost GZSL classification accuracy, but there is one important missing constraint: there is no guarantee that synthetic visual representations can generate back their semantic feature in a multi-modal cycle-consistent manner. This missing constraint can result in synthetic visual representations that do not represent well their semantic features, which means that the use of this constraint can improve GAN-based approaches. In this paper, we propose the use of such constraint based on a new regularization for the GAN training that forces the generated visual features to reconstruct their original semantic features. Once our model is trained with this multi-modal cycle-consistent semantically, we can then synthesize more representative visual features for the seen and, more importantly, for the unseen classes. Our proposed approach shows the best GZSL classification results in the field in several publicly available datasets.",

Rather than simply projecting color data into a volumetric grid and operating solely in 3D -- which would result in insufficient detail -- we first extract feature maps from associated RGB images. These features are then directly projected into the volumetric feature grid of a 3D network using a differentiable backprojection layer.

More precisely, under a transformation formulation, we aim to match two graphs by minimizing the discrepancy between the original graph and the transformed graph. With a linear representation map of the transformation, the pairwise edge attributes of graphs are explicitly represented by unary node attributes, which enables us to reduce the space and time complexity significantly. Due to an efficient Frank-Wolfe method-based optimization strategy, we can handle graphs with hundreds and thousands of nodes within an acceptable amount of time. Meanwhile, because transformation map can preserve graph structures, a domain adaptation-based strategy is proposed to remove the outliers.

We propose a convolutional neural network that learns to predict occluded portions of the scene layout by looking around foreground objects like cars or pedestrians. But instead of hallucinating RGB values, we show that directly predicting the semantics and depths in the occluded areas enables a better transformation into the top-view. We further show that this initial top-view representation can be significantly enhanced by learning priors and rules about typical road layouts from simulated or, if available, map data. Crucially, training our model does not require costly or subjective human annotations for occluded areas or the top-view, but rather uses readily available annotations for standard semantic segmentation in the perspective view.

In computer vision, this has largely been in the form of dataset evaluation for recognition tasks where summary statistics are used to measure progress. While aggregate performance has continued to improve, understanding individual causes of failure has been difficult, as it is not always clear why a particular face fails to be recognized, or why an impostor is recognized by an algorithm. Importantly, other fields studying vision have addressed this via the use of visual psychophysics: the controlled manipulation of stimuli and careful study of the responses they evoke in a model system. In this paper, we suggest that visual psychophysics is a viable methodology for making face recognition algorithms more explainable. A comprehensive set of procedures is developed for assessing face recognition algorithm behavior, which is then deployed over state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and more basic, yet still widely used, shallow and handcrafted feature-based approaches.",

		"abstract": "Many classical Computer Vision problems, such as essential matrix computation and pose estimation from 3D to 2D correspondences, can be solved by finding the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest, or zero, eigenvalue of a matrix representing a linear system. Incorporating this in deep learning frameworks would allow us to explicitly encode known notions of geometry, instead of having the network implicitly learn them from data. However, performing eigendecomposition within a network requires the ability to differentiate this operation. Unfortunately, while theoretically doable, this introduces numerical instability in the optimization process in practice. In this paper, we introduce an eigendecomposition-free approach to training a deep network whose loss depends on the eigenvector corresponding to a zero eigenvalue of a matrix predicted by the network. We demonstrate on several tasks, including keypoint matching and 3D pose estimation, that our approach is much more robust than explicit differentiation of the eigendecomposition, It has better convergence properties and yields state-of-the-art results on both tasks.",

		"title": "Deep Domain Generalization via Conditional Invariant Adversarial Networks",
		"abstract": "Domain generalization aims to learn a classification model from multiple source domains and generalize it to unseen target domains. A critical problem in domain generalization involves learning domain-invariant representations. Let $X$ and $Y$ denote the features and the labels, respectively. Under the assumption that the conditional distribution $P(Y|X)$ remains unchanged across domains, earlier approaches to domain generalization learned the invariant representation $T(X)$ by minimizing the discrepancy of the marginal distribution $P(T(X))$. However, such an assumption of stable $P(Y|X)$ does not necessarily hold in practice. In addition, the representation learning function $T(X)$ is usually constrained to a simple linear transformation or shallow networks. To address the above two drawbacks, we propose an end-to-end conditional invariant deep domain generalization approach by leveraging deep neural networks for domain-invariant representation learning. The domain-invariance property is guaranteed through a conditional invariant adversarial network that can learn domain-invariant representations w.r.t. the joint distribution $P(T(X),Y)$ if the target domain data are not severely class unbalanced. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Thus far, however, point features have been abstracted in an independent and isolated manner, ignoring the relative layout of neighboring points as well as their features. In the present article, we propose to overcome this limitation by using spectral graph convolution on a local graph, combined with a novel graph pooling strategy. In our approach, graph convolution is carried out on a nearest neighbor graph constructed from a point's neighborhood, such that features are jointly learned. We replace the standard max pooling step with a recursive clustering and pooling strategy, devised to aggregate information from within clusters of nodes that are close to one another in their spectral coordinates, leading to richer overall feature descriptors. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, we show a consistent demonstrable advantage for the tasks of both point set classification and segmentation.",

Given a large collection of real photographs with automatically recorded EXIF meta-data, we train a model to determine whether an image is self-consistent -- that is, whether its content could have been produced by a single imaging pipeline. We apply this self-supervised learning method to the task of localizing spliced image content. Our forensics model achieves state of the art results on many benchmarks, despite being trained without examples of actual manipulations, and without modeling specific detection cues.

Motivated by the fact that the performance of facial landmark detection depends heavily on the accuracy of the generated bounding boxes, we exploit the interactions of these two tasks in probabilistic manner by following a Bayesian model and propose a unified framework for simultaneous bounding box tracking and landmark detection. By formulating it as a Markov decision process, we define two agents to exploit the relationships and pass messages via an adaptive sequence of actions under a deep reinforcement learning framework to iteratively adjust the positions of the bounding boxes and facial landmarks.

Recent advances in representation learning have led to considerable improvements in this area. Many state of the art edge detection models are learned with fully convolutional networks (FCNs). However, FCN-based edge learning tends to be vulnerable to misaligned labels due to the delicate structure of edges. While such problem was considered in evaluation benchmarks, similar issue has not been explicitly addressed in general edge learning. In this paper, we show that label misalignment can cause considerably degraded edge learning quality, and address this issue by proposing a simultaneous edge alignment and learning framework. To this end, we formulate a probabilistic model where edge alignment is treated as latent variable optimization, and is learned end-to-end during network training. Experiments show several applications of this work, including improved edge detection with state of the art performance, and automatic refinement of noisy annotations.",

Data-driven approaches, such as deep neural networks, can deal with the ambiguity inherent in this task to some extent, but it is extremely expensive to acquire the temporal annotations of a large-scale video dataset. To leverage the plentiful web-crawled videos to improve the performance of video summarization, we present a generative modelling framework to learn the latent semantic video representations to bridge the benchmark data and web data. Specifically, our framework couples two important components: a variational autoencoder for learning the latent semantics from web videos, and an encoder-attention-decoder for saliency estimation of raw video and summary generation. A loss term to learn the semantic matching between the generated summaries and web videos is presented, and the overall framework is further formulated into a unified conditional variational encoder-decoder, called variational encoder-summarizer-decoder (VESD).

Learning this information from any real training set seems unlikely, and representing it in a reasonable number of weights doubly so. We propose instead to approach VQA as a meta learning task, thus separating the question answering method from the information required. At test time, the method is provided with a support set of example questions/answers, over which it reasons to resolve the given question. The support set is not fixed and can be extended without retraining, thereby expanding the capabilities of the model. To exploit this dynamically provided information, we adapt a state-of-the-art VQA model with two techniques from the recent meta learning literature, namely prototypical networks and meta networks. Experiments demonstrate the capability of the system to learn to produce completely novel answers (i.e. never seen during training) from examples provided at test time. In comparison to the existing state of the art, the proposed method produces qualitatively distinct results with higher recall of rare answers, and a better sample efficiency that allows training with little initial data. More importantly, it represents an important step towards vision-and-language methods that can learn and reason on-the-fly.",

		"title": "Generative Semantic Manipulation with Mask-Contrasting GAN",

On the other hand, while some researches can synthesize compelling real-world images given a class label or caption, they cannot condition on arbitrary shapes or structures, which largely limits their application scenarios and interpretive capability of model results. In this work, we focus on a more challenging semantic manipulation task, aiming at modifying the semantic meaning of an object while preserving its own characteristics (e.g. viewpoints and shapes), such as cow$ ightarrow$sheep, motor$ ightarrow$ bicycle, cat$ ightarrow$dog. To tackle such large semantic changes, we introduce a contrasting GAN (contrast-GAN) with a novel adversarial contrasting objective which is able to perform all types of semantic translations with one category-conditional generator. Instead of directly making the synthesized samples close to target data as previous GANs did, our adversarial contrasting objective optimizes over the distance comparisons between samples, that is, enforcing the manipulated data be semantically closer to the real data with target category than the input data. Equipped with the new contrasting objective, a novel mask-conditional contrast-GAN architecture is proposed to enable disentangle image background with object semantic changes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on several semantic manipulation tasks on ImageNet and MSCOCO dataset show considerable performance gain by our contrast-GAN over other conditional GANs.",

Human drivers also heavily exploit their mental map for navigation. Nonetheless, several methods have been published that learn driving models with only a front-facing camera and without a route planner. This lack of information renders the self-driving task quite intractable. We investigate the problem in a more realistic setting, which consists of a surround-view camera system with eight cameras, a route planner, and a CAN bus reader. In particular, we develop a sensor setup that provides data for a 360-degree view of the area surrounding the vehicle, the driving route to the destination, and low-level driving maneuvers (e.g. steering angle and speed) by human drivers. With such a sensor setup we collect a new driving dataset, covering diverse driving scenarios and varying weather/illumination conditions. Finally, we learn a novel driving model by integrating information from the surround-view cameras and the route planner. Two route planners are exploited: 1) by representing the planned routes on OpenStreetMap as a stack of GPS coordinates, and 2) by rendering the planned routes on TomTom Go Mobile and recording the progression into a video. Our experiments show that: 1) 360-degree surround-view cameras help avoid failures made with a single front-view camera, in particular for city driving and intersection scenarios; and 2) route planners help the driving task significantly, especially for steering angle prediction.",

In stark contrast to flow-based methods, we formulate HDR imaging as an image translation problem without optical flows.

Existing methods use sliding window computation for choosing an image-window that best matches the tem- plate. For classic algorithms based on SSD, SAD and normalized cross- correlation, efficient algorithms have been developed allowing them to run in real-time. Current state of the art algorithms are based on nearest neighbor (NN) matching of small patches within the template to patches in the image. These algorithms yield state-of-the-art results since they can deal better with changes in appearance, viewpoint, illumination, non- rigid transformations, and occlusion. However, NN-based algorithms are relatively slow not only due to NN computation for each image patch, but also since their sliding window computation is inecient. We there- fore propose in this paper an efficient NN-based algorithm. Its accuracy is similar (in some cases slightly better) than the existing algorithms and its running time is 44-200 times faster depending on the sizes of the images and templates used. The main contribution of our method is an algorithm for incrementally computing the score of each image window based on the score computed for the previous window. This is in con- trast to computing the score for each image window independently, as in previous NN-based methods.

		"abstract": "We present an interpretable framework for path prediction that leverages dependencies between agents' behaviors and their spatial navigation environment. We exploit two sources of information: the past motion trajectory of the agent of interest and a wide top-view image of the navigation scene. We propose a Clairvoyant Attentive Recurrent Network (CAR-Net) that learns where to look in a large image of the scene when solving the path prediction task. Our method can attend to any area, or a combination of areas, within the raw image (e.g., road intersections) when predicting the trajectory of the agent. This allows us to visualize fine-grained semantic elements of navigation scenes that influence the prediction of trajectories. To study the impact of space on agents' trajectories, we build a new dataset made of top-view images of hundreds of scenes (Formula One racing tracks) where agents' behaviors are heavily influenced by known areas in the images (e.g., upcoming turns). CAR-Net successfully attends to these salient regions. Additionally, CAR-Net reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on the standard trajectory forecasting benchmark, Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). Finally, we show CAR-Net's ability to generalize to unseen scenes.",

		"abstract": "We propose a dynamic filtering strategy with large sampling field for ConvNets (LS-DFN), where the position-specific kernels learn from not only the identical position but also multiple sampled neighbour regions. During sampling, residual learning is introduced to ease training and an attention mechanism is applied to fuse features from different samples. Such multiple samples enlarge the kernels’ receptive fields significantly without requiring more parameters. While LS-DFN inherits the advantages of DFN, namely avoiding feature map blurring by position-wise kernels while keeping translation invariance, it also efficiently alleviates the overfitting issue caused by much more parameters than normal CNNs. Our model is efficient and can be trained end-to-end via standard back-propagation. We demonstrate the merits of our LS-DFN on both sparse and dense prediction tasks involving object detection, semantic segmentation and flow estimation. Our results show LS-DFN enjoys stronger recognition abilities in object detection and semantic segmentation tasks on VOC benchmark and sharper responses in flow estimation on FlyingChairs dataset compared to strong baselines.",

Given a single image at an arbitrary viewpoint, a CNN predicts multiple surfaces, each in a canonical location relative to the object. Each surface comprises a depth-map and corresponding deformation-field that ensures every pixel-depth pair in the depth-map lies on the object surface. These surfaces are then fused to form the full 3D shape. During training, we use a combination of per-view and multi-view losses.

		"title": "Fast and Accurate Intrinsic Symmetry Detection",

In this work, we detect the intrinsic reflective symmetry in triangle meshes where we have to find the intrinsically symmetric point for each point of the shape. We establish correspondences between functions defined on the shapes by extending the functional map framework and then recover the point-to-point correspondences. Previous approaches using the functional map for this task find the functional correspondences matrix by solving a non-linear optimization problem which makes them slow. In this work, we propose a closed form solution for this matrix which makes our approach faster. We find the closed-form solution based on our following results. If the given shape is intrinsically symmetric, then the shortest length geodesic between two intrinsically symmetric points is also intrinsically symmetric. If an eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for the given shape is an even (odd) function, then its restriction on the shortest length geodesic between two intrinsically symmetric points is also an even (odd) function. The sign of a low-frequency eigenfunction is the same on the neighboring points. Our method is invariant to the ordering of the eigenfunctions and has the least time complexity.

To address this, we develop a deep prediction-decision network in our C-DRL, which simultaneously detects and predicts objects under a unified network via deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider each object as an agent and track it via the prediction network, and seek the optimal tracked results by exploiting the collaborative interactions of different agents and environments via the decision network, so that the influences of occlusions and noisy detection results can be well alleviated.

However, these methods ignore a fact that in the central latent space, the distribution of variance within classes is actually independent on classes. In this paper, we propose a deep variational metric learning (DVML) framework to explicitly model the intra-class variance and disentangle the intra-class invariance, namely, the class centers. With the learned distribution of intra-class variance, we can simultaneously generate discriminative samples to improve robustness. Our method is applicable to most of existing metric learning algorithms, and extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets including CUB-200-2011, Cars196 and Stanford Online Products show that our DVML significantly boosts the performance of currently popular deep metric learning methods.",

Our model consists of a two-stream network, which generates appearance and body part feature maps respectively, and a bilinear-pooling layer that fuses two feature maps to an image descriptor.

		"abstract": "Point cloud registration sits at the core of many important and challenging 3D perception problems including autonomous navigation, SLAM, object/scene recognition, and augmented reality. In this paper, we present a new registration algorithm that is able to achieve state-of-the-art speed and accuracy through its use of a Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture representation. Our method, Hierarchical Gaussian Mixture Registration (HGMR), constructs a top-down multi-scale representation of point cloud data by recursively running many small-scale data likelihood segmentations in parallel on a GPU. We leverage the resulting representation using a novel optimization criterion that adaptively finds the best scale to perform data association between spatial subsets of point cloud data. Compared to previous Iterative Closest Point and GMM-based techniques, our tree-based point association algorithm performs data association in logarithmic-time while dynamically adjusting the level of detail to best match the complexity and spatial distribution characteristics of local scene geometry. In addition, unlike other GMM methods that restrict covariances to be isotropic, our new PCA-based optimization criterion well-approximates the true MLE solution even when fully anisotropic Gaussian covariances are used. Efficient data association, multi-scale adaptability, and a robust MLE approximation produce an algorithm that is up to an order of magnitude both faster and more accurate than current state-of-the-art on a wide variety of 3D datasets captured from LiDAR to structured light.",

		"abstract": "Attention-based learning for fine-grained image recognition remains a challenging task, where most of the existing methods treat each object part in isolation, while neglecting the correlations among them. In addition, the multi-stage or multi-scale mechanisms involved make the existing methods less efficient and hard to be trained end-to-end. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) which regulates multiple object parts among different input images. Our method first learns multiple attention region features of each input image through the one-squeeze multi-excitation (OSME) module, and then apply the multi-attention multi-class constraint (MAMC) in a metric learning framework. For each anchor feature, the MAMC functions by pulling same-attention same-class features closer, while pushing different-attention or different-class features away. Our method can be easily trained end-to-end, and is highly efficient which requires only one training stage. Moreover, we introduce Dogs-in-the-Wild, a comprehensive dog species dataset that surpasses similar existing datasets by category coverage, data volume and annotation quality. This dataset will be released upon acceptance to facilitate the research of fine-grained image recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the substantial improvements of our method on four benchmark datasets.",

		"title": "From Face Recognition to Models of Identity: A Bayesian Approach to Learning about Unknown Identities from Unsupervised Data",
		"abstract": "Current face recognition systems robustly recognize identities across a wide variety of imaging conditions. In these systems recognition is performed via classification into known identities obtained from supervised identity annotations. There are two problems with this current paradigm: (1) current systems are unable to benefit from unlabelled data which may be available in large quantities; and (2) current systems equate successful recognition with labelling a given input image. Humans, on the other hand, regularly perform identification of individuals completely unsupervised, recognising the identity of someone they have seen before even without being able to name that individual. How can we go beyond the current classification paradigm towards a more human understanding of identities? We propose an integrated Bayesian model that coherently reasons about the observed images, identities, partial knowledge about names, and the situational context of each observation. While our model achieves good recognition performance against known identities, it can also discover new identities from unsupervised data and learns to associate identities with different contexts depending on which identities tend to be observed together. In addition, the proposed semi-supervised component is able to handle not only acquaintances, whose names are known, but also unlabelled familiar faces and complete strangers in a unified framework.",

In this paper we show theoretically and empirically that constructing dense pixel embeddings that can separate object instances cannot be easily achieved using convolutional operators. At the same time, we show that simple modifications, which we call semi-convolutional, have a much better chance of succeeding at this task. We use the latter to show a connection to Hough voting as well as to a variant of the bilateral kernel that is spatially steered by a convolutional network. We demonstrate that these operators can also be used to improve approaches such as Mask RCNN, demonstrating better segmentation of complex biological shapes and PASCAL VOC categories than achievable by Mask RCNN alone.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to simultaneous pedestrian detection and occlusion estimation by regressing two bounding boxes to localize the full body as well as the visible part of a pedestrian respectively. For this purpose, we learn a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of two branches, one for full body estimation and the other for visible part estimation. The two branches are treated differently during training such that they are learned to produce complementary outputs which can be further fused to improve detection performance. The full body estimation branch is trained to regress full body regions for positive pedestrian proposals, while the visible part estimation branch is trained to regress visible part regions for both positive and negative pedestrian proposals. The visible part region of a negative pedestrian proposal is forced to shrink to its center. In addition, we introduce a new criterion for selecting positive training examples, which contributes largely to heavily occluded pedestrian detection. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed bi-box regression approach on the Caltech and CityPersons datasets. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance for detecting both non-occluded and occluded pedestrians, especially heavily occluded ones.",

Instead of learning the distribution of the data fitting errors, we directly learn the associated shrinkage function for the data term using a cascaded architecture, which is more flexible and efficient.

However, most of them do not account for face structure and suffer from degradations due to large pose variations and misalignments of faces. Our method incorporates structural information of faces explicitly into face super-resolution by using a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN). Our CNN has two branches: one for super-resolving face images and the other branch for predicting salient regions of a face coined facial component heatmaps. These heatmaps guide the up-sampling stream for generating better super-resolved faces with high-quality details. Our method uses not only the low-level information (ie intensity similarity), but also middle-level information (ie face structure) to further explore spatial constraints of facial components from LR inputs images. Therefore, we are able to super-resolve very small unaligned face images (16$ imes$16 pixels) with a large upscaling factor of 8$ imes$ while preserving face structure.

On the other hand, algorithms for creating decision-boundary crossing transformations (e.g., adversarial examples) produce differences that are visually imperceptible and do not enable insightful explanation. To address this we introduce ExplainGAN, a generative model that produces visually perceptible decision-boundary crossing transformations.

Most of the traditional 3D networks use local spatio-temporal features. We introduce a new block that models correlations between channels of a 3D CNN with respect to temporal and spatial features. This new block can be added as a residual unit to different parts of 3D CNNs. We name our novel block 'Spatio-Temporal Channel Correlation' (STC). By embedding this block to the current state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNext and ResNet, we improve the performance by 2-3% on the Kinetics dataset. Our experiments show that adding STC blocks to current state-of-the-art architectures outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics datasets. The other issue in training 3D CNNs is about training them from scratch with a huge labeled dataset to get a reasonable performance. So the knowledge learned in 2D CNNs is completely ignored. Another contribution in this work is a simple and effective technique to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained 2D CNN to a randomly initialized 3D CNN for a stable weight initialization. This allows us to significantly reduce the number of training samples for 3D CNNs. Thus, by fine-tuning this network, we beat the performance of generic and recent methods in 3D CNNs, which were trained on large video datasets, e.g. Sports-1M, and fine-tuned on the target datasets, e.g. HMDB51/UCF101.",

In this paper, we aim to characterize adversarial examples based on spatial context information in segmentation. We observe that spatial consistency information can be potentially leveraged to recognize/detect adversarial examples robustly even when facing adaptive attacker who has access to the model and detection strategies.

More precisely, our approach is based on the insight that having a good generalization from few examples relies on both a generic initial model and an effective strategy for adapting this model to novel tasks.

Recent research in the field has tackled this problem by exploiting the expressiveness of deep convolutional networks. In fact, there is another level of ambiguity that is often overlooked: there are usually multiple plausible shapes that fit the 2D image equally well; i.e., the ground truth shape is non-deterministic given the input. Existing fully supervised approaches fail to address this issue, and often produce blurry mean shapes with smooth surfaces but no fine details. In this paper, we propose ShapeHD, pushing the limit of single-view shape completion and reconstruction by integrating deep generative models with adversarially learned shape priors. The learned priors serve as a regularizer, penalizing the model only if its output is unrealistic, not if it deviates from the ground truth.

While a metric loss applied to the deepest layer of a CNN, is often expected to yield ideal features irrespective of the task, in fact the growing receptive field as well as striding effects cause shallower features to be better at high precision matching tasks. We leverage this insight together with explicit supervision at multiple levels of the feature hierarchy for better regularization, to learn more effective descriptors in the context of geometric matching tasks. Further, we propose to use activation maps at different layers of a CNN, as an effective and principled replacement for the multi-resolution image pyramids often used for matching tasks.

DCCN consists of dual subnets: DyConvNet contains a dynamic convolutional layer with a bank of basis filters; CondiNet predicts a set of adaptive weights from conditional inputs to linearly combine the basis filters. In this manner, a specific convolutional kernel can be dynamically obtained for each conditional input. The filter bank is shared between all conditions thus only a low-dimension weight vector needs to be learned. This significantly facilitates the parameter learning across different conditions when training data are limited. We evaluate DCCN on four tasks which can be formulated as conditional model learning, including specific object counting, multi-modal image classification, phrase grounding and identity based face generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in the conditional few-shot learning setting.",

		"abstract": "Image geolocalization is the task of identifying the location depicted in a photo based only on its visual information. This task is inherently challenging since many photos have only few, possibly ambiguous cues to their geolocation. Recent work has cast this task as a classification problem by partitioning the earth into a set of discrete cells that correspond to geographic regions. The granularity of this partitioning presents a critical trade-off; using fewer but larger cells results in lower location accuracy while using more but smaller cells reduces the number of training examples per class and increases model size, making the model prone to overfitting. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple but effective algorithm, combinatorial partitioning, which generates a large number of fine-grained output classes by intersecting multiple coarse-grained partitionings of the earth. Each classifier votes for the fine-grained classes that overlap with their respective coarse-grained ones. This technique allows us to predict locations at a fine scale while maintaining sufficient training examples per class.

The scene is first segmented into four classes with a Markov random field combining height and image features. In the following modeling step, various 2D line segments sketching the roof boundaries are detected and slice the plane into faces.

Unlike existing methods which usually employ a general relaxation framework to adapt to the gradient-based algorithms, our approach formulates the non-smooth part of the hashing network as sampling with a stochastic policy, so that the retrieval performance degradation caused by the relaxation can be avoided. Specifically, our method directly generates the binary codes and maximizes the expectation of rewards for similarity preservation, where the network can be trained directly via policy gradient. Hence, the differentiation challenge for discrete optimization can be naturally addressed, which leads to effective gradients and binary codes.

These are established by drawing an analogy with Shape-from-Template (SfT). The main idea consists in considering that RS distortions due to camera ego-motion during image acquisition can be interpreted as virtual deformations of a template captured by a GS camera. Once the virtual deformations have been recovered using SfT, the camera pose and ego-motion are computed by registering the deformed scene on the original template. This 3D-3D registration involves a 3D cost function based on the Euclidean point distance, more physically meaningful than the re-projection error or the algebraic distance based cost functions used in previous work.

However, it is still difficult to reconstruct a high-quality light field from only a few acquired images.

We introduce a novel imaging method that enables the decomposition of the appearance of a fronto-parallel real-world surface into images of light with bounded path lengths, i.e., transient subsurface light transport. Our key idea is to observe each surface point under a variable ring light: a circular illumination pattern of increasingly larger radius centered on it. We show that the path length of light captured in each of these observations is naturally lower-bounded by the ring light radius. By taking the difference of ring light images of incrementally larger radii, we compute transient images that encode light with bounded path lengths. Experimental results on synthetic and complex real-world surfaces demonstrate that the recovered transient images reveal the subsurface structure of general translucent inhomogeneous surfaces. We further show that their differences reveal the surface colors at different surface depths.

Here, we observe that the use of a single registration often leads to errors, especially in scenes with significant depth variation or object motion. We propose instead the use of multiple registrations, permitting regions of the image at different depths to be captured with greater accuracy. MRF inference techniques naturally extend to seam finding over multiple registrations, and we show here that their energy functions can be readily modified with new terms that discourage duplication and tearing, common problems that are exacerbated by the use of multiple registrations.

Ideally, an SBIR model should learn to associate components in the sketch (say, feet, tail, etc.) with the corresponding components in the image. However, current evaluation methods simply focus only on coarse-grained evaluation where the focus is on retrieving images which belong to the same class as the sketch but not necessarily having the same components as in the sketch. As a result, existing methods simply learn to associate sketches with classes seen during training and hence fail to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a new bench mark for zero-shot SBIR where the model is evaluated on novel classes that are not seen during training. We show through extensive experiments that existing models for SBIR which are trained in a discriminative setting learn only class specific mappings and fail to generalize to the proposed zero-shot setting. To circumvent this, we propose a generative approach for the SBIR task by proposing deep conditional generative models which take the sketch as an input and fill the missing information stochastically. Experiments on this new benchmark created from the \"Sketchy\" dataset, which is a large-scale database of sketch-photo pairs demonstrate that the performance of these generative models is significantly better than several state-of-the-art approaches in the proposed zero-shot framework of the coarse-grained SBIR task.",

		"abstract": "Visual question answering (VQA) has drawn great attention in cross-modal learning problems, which enables a machine to answer a natural language question given a reference image. Significant progress has been made by learning rich embedding features from images and questions by bilinear models, while neglects the key role from answers. In this paper, we propose a novel deep attention neural tensor network (DA-NTN) for visual question answering, which can discover the joint correlations over images, questions and answers with tensor-based representations. First, we model one of the pairwise interaction (e.g., image and question) by bilinear features, which is further encoded with the third dimension (e.g., answer) to be a triplet by bilinear tensor product. Second, we decompose the correlation of different triplets by different answer and question types, and further propose a slice-wise attention module on tensor to select the most discriminative reasoning process for inference. Third, we optimize the proposed DA-NTN by learning a label regression with KL-divergence losses. Such a design enables scalable training and fast convergence over a large number of answer set. We integrate the proposed DA-NTN structure into the state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., MLB and MUTAN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior accuracy than the original MLB and MUTAN models, with 1.98%, 1.70% relative increases on VQA-2.0 dataset, respectively.",

We work with a challenging set of object classes, not restricting ourselves to similar and/or fine-grained categories as in prior works on zero-shot classification. We present a principled approach by first adapting visual-semantic embeddings for ZSD. We then discuss the problems associated with selecting a background class and motivate two background-aware approaches for learning robust detectors. One of these models uses a fixed background class and the other is based on iterative latent assignments. We also outline the challenge associated with using a limited number of training classes and propose a solution based on dense sampling of the semantic label space using auxiliary data with a large number of categories. We propose novel splits of two standard detection datasets – MSCOCO and VisualGenome, and present extensive empirical results in both the traditional and generalized zero-shot settings to highlight the benefits of the proposed methods. We provide useful insights into the algorithm and conclude by posing some open questions to encourage further research.",

		"title": "Asynchronous, Photometric Feature Tracking using Events and Frames",
		"abstract": "We present a method that leverages the complementarity of event cameras and standard cameras to track visual features with low-latency. Event cameras are novel sensors that output pixel-level brightness changes, called \"events\". They offer significant advantages over standard cameras, namely a very high dynamic range, no motion blur, and a latency in the order of microseconds. However, because the same scene pattern can produce different events depending on the motion direction, establishing event correspondences across time is challenging. By contrast, standard cameras provide intensity measurements (frames) that do not depend on motion direction. Our method extracts features on frames and subsequently tracks them asynchronously using events, thereby exploiting the best of both types of data: the frames provide a photometric representation that does not depend on motion direction and the events provide low-latency updates. In contrast to previous works, which are based on heuristics, this is the first principled method that uses raw intensity measurements directly, based on a generative event model within a maximum-likelihood framework. As a result, our method produces feature tracks that are both more accurate (subpixel accuracy) and longer than the state of the art, across a wide variety of scenes.",

Unlike the prior supervised deep-learning works that extensively rely on large sets of paired data, which is highly demanding and challenging to obtain, we propose an unsupervised training scheme with unpaired data to achieve the same. Our model consists of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that learns a strong prior on the clean image domain using adversarial loss and maps the blurred image to its clean equivalent. To improve the stability of GAN and to preserve the image correspondence, we introduce an additional CNN module that reblurs the generated GAN output to match with the blurred input. Along with these two modules, we also make use of the blurred image itself to self-guide the network to constrain the solution space of generated clean images. This self-guidance is achieved by imposing a scale-space gradient error with an additional gradient module. We train our model on different classes and observe that adding the reblur and gradient modules help in better convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art supervised methods on both synthetic and real-world images even in the absence of any supervision.",

To this end, we present two new pooling cells to encourage feature interactions: (i) Contrastive ROI Pooling Cell, which has a unique deROI pooling that inversely pools local object features to the corresponding area of global predicate features. (ii) Pyramid ROI Pooling Cell, which broadcasts global predicate features to reinforce local object features.The two cells constitute a Spatiality-Context-Appearance Module (SCA-M), which can be further stacked consecutively to form our final Zoom-Net.We further shed light on how one could resolve ambiguous and noisy object and predicate annotations by Intra-Hierarchical trees (IH-tree). Extensive experiments conducted on Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature-oriented approach compared to state-of-the-art methods (Acc@1 11.42% from 8.16%) that depend on explicit modeling of linguistic interactions.

By replacing the numerous relationship representations of the scene graph with fewer subgraph and object features, the computation in the intermediate stage is significantly reduced. In addition, spatial information is maintained by the subgraph features, which is leveraged by our proposed Spatial-weighted Message Passing (SMP) structure and Spatial-sensitive Relation Inference (SRI) module to facilitate the relationship recognition.

		"abstract": "We introduce a saliency-based distortion layer for convolutional neural networks that helps to improve the spatial sampling of input data for a given task. Our differentiable layer can be added as a preprocessing block to existing task networks and trained altogether in an end-to-end fashion. The effect of the layer is to efficiently estimate how to sample from the original data in order to boost task performance. For example, for an image classification task in which the original data might range in size up to several megapixels, but where the desired input images to the task network are much smaller, our layer learns how best to sample from the underlying high resolution data in a manner which preserves task-relevant information better than uniform downsampling. This has the effect of creating distorted, caricature-like intermediate images, in which idiosyncratic elements of the image that improve task performance are zoomed and exaggerated. Unlike alternative approaches such as spatial transformer networks, our proposed layer is inspired by image saliency, computed efficiently from uniformly downsampled data, and degrades gracefully to a uniform sampling strategy under uncertainty. We apply our layer to improve existing networks for the tasks of human gaze estimation and fine-grained object classification.

Diverse auxiliary information has been utilized to improve the visual feature learning. In this paper, we propose to exploit natural language description as additional training supervisions for more effective features. Compared with other auxiliary information, language can describe a specific person from more compact and semantic visual aspects, thus is complementary to the pixel-level image data. Our method not only learns better global visual feature with the supervision of the overall description but also enforces semantic consistencies between local visual and linguistic features, which is achieved by building global and local image-language associations. The global image-language association is established according to the identity labels, while the local association is based upon the implicit correspondences between image regions and noun phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of employing language as training supervisions with the two association schemes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without utilizing any auxiliary information during testing and shows better performance than other joint embedding methods for the image-language association.",

We propose a plug-and-play PickNet to perform informative frame picking in video captioning. Based on a standard encoder-decoder framework, we develop a reinforcement-learning-based procedure to train the network sequentially, where the reward of each frame picking action is designed by maximizing visual diversity and minimizing discrepancy between generated caption and the ground-truth. The rewarded candidate will be selected and the corresponding latent representation of encoder-decoder will be updated for future trials. This procedure goes on until the end of the video sequence. Consequently, a compact frame subset can be selected to represent the visual information and perform video captioning without performance degradation. Experiment results show that our model can achieve competitive performance across popular benchmarks while only 6~8 frames are used.",

The main challenge for an IL algorithm is to update the classifier whilst preserving existing knowledge. We observe that, in addition to forgetting, a known issue while preserving knowledge, IL also suffers from a problem we call intransigence, its inability to update knowledge. We introduce two metrics to quantify forgetting and intransigence that allow us to understand, analyse, and gain better insights into the behaviour of IL algorithms. Furthermore, we present RWalk, a generalization of EWC++ (our efficient version of EWC) and Path Integral with a theoretically grounded KL-divergence based perspective.

Three main challenges exist including spatial (image) feature representation, temporal information representation, and model/computation complexity. It was recently shown by Carreira and Zisserman that 3D CNNs, inflated from 2D networks and pretrained on ImageNet, could be a promising way for spatial and temporal representation learning. However, as for model/computation complexity, 3D CNNs are much more expensive than 2D CNNs and prone to overfit. We seek a balance between speed and accuracy by building an effective and efficient video classification system through systematic exploration of critical network design choices. In particular, we show that it is possible to replace many of the 3D convolutions by low-cost 2D convolutions. Rather surprisingly, best result (in both speed and accuracy) is achieved when replacing the 3D convolutions at the bottom of the network, suggesting that temporal representation learning on high-level ``semantic'' features is more useful. Our conclusion generalizes to datasets with very different properties. When combined with several other cost-effective designs including separable spatial/temporal convolution and feature gating, our system results in an effective video classification system that that produces very competitive results on several action classification benchmarks (Kinetics, Something-something, UCF101 and HMDB), as well as two action detection (localization) benchmarks (JHMDB and UCF101-24).",

While learning from synthetic data where labels are readily available sounds promising, performance degrades significantly when testing on novel realistic data due to domain discrepancies. We present Dual Channel-wise Alignment Networks (DCAN), a simple yet effective approach to reduce domain shift at both pixel-level and feature-level. Exploring statistics in each channel of CNN feature maps, our framework performs channel-wise feature alignment, which preserves spatial structures and semantic information, in both an image generator and a segmentation network. In particular, given an image from the source domain and unlabeled samples from the target domain, the generator synthesizes new images on-the-fly to resemble samples from the target domain in appearance and the segmentation network further refines high-level features before predicting semantic maps, both of which leverage feature statistics of sampled images from the target domain.

The method can recover the 3D page shape by exploiting the intrinsic vector fields of the image.

Then the spatial directrix of the surface is recovered by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) through the Euler method. Finally, the geometric distortions in images can be rectified by flattening the estimated 3D page surface onto a plane. Our method can exploit diverse types of visual cues available in a distorted document image to estimate its vector fields for 3D page shape recovery. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, the great advantage is that it is a segment-free method and does not have to extract curved text lines or textual blocks, which is still a very challenging problem especially for a distorted document image. Our method can therefore be freely applied to document images with extremely complicated page layouts and severe image quality degradation.

By combining the proposed runtime control strategies, our network can achieve continuous changes in stroke sizes and produce distinct stroke sizes in different spatial regions within the same output image.",

		"title": "A Modulation Module for Multi-task Learning with Applications in Image Retrieval",
		"abstract": "Multi-task learning has been widely adopted in many computer vision tasks to improve overall computation efficiency or boost the performance of individual tasks, under the assumption that those tasks are correlated and complementary to each other. However, the relationships between the tasks are complicated in practice, especially when the number of involved tasks scales up. When two tasks are of weak relevance, they may compete or even distract each other during joint training shared parameters, and as a consequence undermine the learning of all the tasks. This will raise destructive interference which decreases learning efficiency of shared parameters and lead to low quality local optimum of shared parameters. To address the this problem, we propose a general modulation module, which can be inserted into any convolutional neural network architecture, to encourage the coupling and feature sharing of relevant tasks while disentangling the learning of irrelevant tasks with minor parameters addition. Equipped with this module, gradient directions from different tasks can be enforced to be consistent for those shared parameters, which benefits multi-task joint training. The module is end-to-end learnable without ad-hoc design for specific tasks, and can naturally handle many tasks at the same time. We apply our approach on two retrieval tasks, face retrieval on the CelebA dataset and product retrieval on the UT-Zappos50K dataset, and demonstrate its advantage over other multi-task learning methods in both accuracy and storage efficiency.",

		"abstract": "In this work we introduce the Deforming Autoencoder, a generative model for images that disentangles shape from appearance in a latent representation space that is learned in a fully unsupervised manner. As in the deformable template paradigm, shape is represented as a diffeomorphism between a canonical coordinate system (`template') and an observed image, while appearance is modeled in template coordinates, thus discarding variability due to deformations. We introduce novel techniques that allow this approach to be deployed in the setting of autoencoders and show that this method can be used for unsupervised group-wise image alignment. We show experiments with expression morphing in humans, hands, and digits, face manipulation, such as shape and appearance interpolation, as well as unsupervised landmark localization. A more powerful form of unsupervised disentangling becomes possible in template coordinates, allowing us to successfully decompose face images into shading and albedo, and further manipulate face images.",

The main idea is a self-supervised training objective that, given only a single 2D image, requires all unseen views of the object to be predictable from learned features. We implement this idea as an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network. The network maps an input image of an unknown category and unknown viewpoint to a latent space, from which a deconvolutional decoder can best “lift” the image to its complete viewgrid showing the object from all viewing angles. Our class-agnostic training procedure encourages the representation to capture fundamental shape primitives and semantic regularities in a data-driven manner—without manual semantic labels. Our results on two widely-used shape datasets show 1) our approach successfully learns to perform “mental rotation” even for objects unseen during training, and 2) the learned latent space is a powerful representation for object recognition, outperforming several existing unsupervised feature learning methods.",

Without adding any inputs, our approach is able to utilize more elements for training to achieve more powerful feature via the combination of original samples. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical analysis by combining comparison of gradients and back-propagation, to prove the effectiveness of our method.

However, existing person re-identification models mostly estimate the similarities of different image pairs of probe and gallery images independently while ignores the relationship information between different probe-gallery pairs. As a result, the similarity estimation of some hard samples might not be accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, named Similarity-Guided Graph Neural Network (SGGNN) to overcome such limitations. Given a probe image and several gallery images, SGGNN creates a graph to represent the pairwise relationships between probe-gallery pairs (nodes) and utilizes such relationships to update the probe-gallery relation features in an end-to-end manner. Accurate similarity estimation can be achieved by using such updated probe-gallery relation features for prediction. The input features for nodes on the graph are the relation features of different probe-gallery image pairs. The probe-gallery relation feature updating is then performed by the messages passing in SGGNN, which takes other nodes' information into account for similarity estimation. Different from conventional GNN approaches, SGGNN learns the edge weights with rich labels of gallery instance pairs directly, which provides relation fusion more precise information. The effectiveness of our proposed method is validated on three public person re-identification datasets.",

Based on the observation that faces can exhibit strong highlight reflections from a broad range of lighting directions, we propose a deep neural network for extracting highlights from faces, and then trace these reflections back to the scene to acquire the environment map. Since real training data for highlight extraction is very limited, we introduce an unsupervised scheme for finetuning the network on real images, based on the consistent diffuse chromaticity of a given face seen in multiple real images. In tracing the estimated highlights to the environment, we reduce the blurring effect of skin reflectance on reflected light through a deconvolution determined by prior knowledge on face material properties. Comparisons to previous techniques for highlight extraction and illumination estimation show the state-of-the-art performance of this approach on a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes.",

A generator network generates a fake image as well as a mask based on the encoder-decoder framework. On the other hand, a discriminator network aims to detect fake images. The network is trained with three losses to consider spatial, appearance, and adversarial information. The spatial loss determines whether the locations of predicted parts are correct. Input patches are restored in the output image without much modification due to the appearance loss. The adversarial loss ensures output images are realistic.

		"title": "Visual Text Correction",
		"abstract": "Videos, images, and sentences are mediums that can express the same semantics. One can imagine a picture by reading a sentence or can describe a scene with some words. However, even small changes in a sentence can cause a significant semantic inconsistency with the corresponding video/image. For example, by changing the verb of a sentence, the meaning may drastically change. There have been many efforts to encode a video/sentence and decode it as a sentence/video. In this research, we study a new scenario in which both the sentence and the video are given, but the sentence is inaccurate. A semantic inconsistency between the sentence and the video or between the words of a sentence can result in an inaccurate description. This paper introduces a new problem, called Visual Text Correction (VTC), i.e., finding and replacing an inaccurate word in the textual description of a video. We propose a deep network that can simultaneously detect an inaccuracy in a sentence, and fix it by replacing the inaccurate word(s). Our method leverages the semantic interdependence of videos and words, as well as the short-term and long-term relations of the words in a sentence. In our formulation, part of a visual feature vector for every single word is dynamically selected through a gating process. Furthermore, to train and evaluate our model, we propose an approach to automatically construct a large dataset for VTC problem. Our experiments and performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed method provides very good results and also highlights the general challenges in solving the VTC problem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind for the Visual Text Correction task.",

However, they suffer from three limitations: (1) incapability of generating image by exemplars; (2) being unable to transfer multiple face attributes simultaneously; (3) low quality of generated images, such as low-resolution or artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model which receives two images of opposite attributes as inputs. Our model can transfer exactly the same type of attributes from one image to another by exchanging certain part of their encodings. All the attributes are encoded in a disentangled manner in the latent space, which enables us to manipulate several attributes simultaneously. Besides, our model learns the residual images so as to facilitate training on higher resolution images. With the help of multi-scale discriminators for adversarial training, it can even generate high-quality images with finer details and less artifacts.

We also judiciously retain the coarser textures for stereo matching, discarding the finer textures as they are apt to be inextricably mixed with noise. This selection process in the structure-texture decomposition step is aided by the stereo matching constraint in our joint Structure-Stereo formulation.

In this paper, we wish to solve two specific problems: (1) given two or more synchronized third-person videos of a scene, produce a pixel-level segmentation of each visible person and identify corresponding people across different views (i.e., determine who in camera A corresponds with whom in camera B), and (2) given one or more synchronized third-person videos as well as a first-person video taken by a mobile or wearable camera, segment and identify the camera wearer in the third-person videos. Unlike previous work which requires ground truth bounding boxes to estimate the correspondences, we perform person segmentation and identification jointly. We find that solving these two problems simultaneously is mutually beneficial, because better fine-grained segmentation allows us to better perform matching across views, and information from multiple views helps us perform more accurate segmentation.

A novel bootstrapping technique is designed which samples multiple ‘subsections’ of a word or text line and accordingly relieves the constraint of limited training data effectively. At the same time, the repeated sampling of text ‘subsections’ improves the consistency of the predicted text feature maps which is critical in predicting a single complete instead of multiple broken boxes for long words or text lines. In addition, a semantics-aware text border detection technique is designed which produces four types of text border segments for each scene text. With semantics-aware text borders, scene texts can be localized more accurately by regressing text pixels around the ends of words or text lines instead of all text pixels which often leads to inaccurate localization while dealing with long words or text lines. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, and superior performance is obtained over several public datasets, e. g. 80.1 f-score for the MSRA-TD500, 67.1 f-score for the ICDAR2017-RCTW, etc.",

		"abstract": "This paper tackles a problem in line-assisted VO/VSLAM: accurately solving the least squares pose optimization with unreliable 3D line input. The solution we present is good line cutting, which extracts the most-informative sub-segment from each 3D line for use within the pose optimization formulation. By studying the impact of line cutting towards the information gain of pose estimation in line-based least squares problem, we demonstrate the applicability of improving pose estimation accuracy with good line cutting. To that end, we describe an efficient algorithm that approximately approaches the joint optimization problem of good line cutting. The proposed algorithm is integrated into a state-of-the-art line-assisted VSLAM system. When evaluated in two target scenarios of line-assisted VO/VSLAM, low-texture and motion blur, the accuracy of pose tracking is improved, while the robustness is preserved.",

However, in many of the most compelling deployment scenarios of compressed deep networks, the operational constraints matter: for example, a pedestrian detection network on a self-driving car may have to satisfy a latency constraint for safe operation. We propose the first principled treatment of deep network compression under operational constraints. We formulate the compression learning problem from the perspective of constrained Bayesian optimization, and introduce a cooling (annealing) strategy to guide the network compression towards the target constraints.

Existing models typically rely on top-down language information and learn attention implicitly by optimizing the captioning objectives. While somewhat effective, the learned top-down attention can fail to focus on correct regions of interest without direct supervision of attention. Inspired by the human visual system which is driven by not only the task-specific top-down signals but also the visual stimuli, we in this work propose to use both types of attention for image captioning. In particular, we highlight the complementary nature of the two types of attention and develop a model (Boosted Attention) to integrate them for image captioning.

		"title": "MaskConnect: Connectivity Learning by Gradient Descent",
		"abstract": "Although deep networks have recently emerged as the model of choice for many computer vision problems, in order to yield good results they often require time-consuming architecture search. To combat the complexity of design choices, prior work has adopted the principle of modularized design which consists in defining the network in terms of a composition of topologically identical or similar building blocks (a.k.a. modules). This reduces architecture search to the problem of determining the number of modules to compose and how to connect such modules. Again, for reasons of design complexity and training cost, previous approaches have relied on simple rules of connectivity, e.g., connecting each module to only the immediately preceding module or perhaps to all of the previous ones. Such simple connectivity rules are unlikely to yield the optimal architecture for the given problem. In this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to learn the connections between modules in the network. Instead of being chosen a priori by the human designer, the connectivity is learned simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing the loss function of the end task using a modified version of gradient descent. We demonstrate our connectivity learning method on the problem of multi-class image classification using two popular architectures: ResNet and ResNeXt. Experiments on four different datasets show that connectivity learning using our approach yields consistently higher accuracy compared to relying on traditional predefined rules of connectivity. Furthermore, in certain settings it leads to significant savings in number of parameters.",

Specifically, we present Graph Convolutional Networks plus Long Short-Term Memory (dubbed as GCN-LSTM) architecture that novelly integrates both semantic and spatial object relationships into image encoder. Technically, we build graphs over the detected objects in an image based on their spatial and semantic connections. The representations of each region proposed on objects are then refined by leveraging graph structure through GCN. With the learnt region-level features, our GCN-LSTM capitalizes on LSTM-based captioning framework with attention mechanism for sentence generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on COCO image captioning dataset, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art approaches.

The task-specific branch estimates task-driven attention shift over a webpage from its semantic components, while the task-free branch infers visual saliency induced by visual features of the webpage. The outputs of the two branches are combined to produce the final prediction. Such a task decomposition framework allows us to efficiently learn our model from a small-scale task-driven saliency dataset with sparse labels (captured under a single task condition).

In today’s age of pre-trained deep networks and their powerful convolutional features, state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches differ mostly in how they choose to combine together these different kinds of information. In this work, we propose a novel scheme for aggregating features from different scales, which we refer to as Multi-Scale Context Intertwining (MSCI). In contrast to previous approaches, which typically propagate information between scales in a one-directional manner, we merge pairs of feature maps in a bidirectional and recurrent fashion, via connections between two LSTM chains. By training the parameters of the LSTM units on the segmentation task, the above approach learns how to extract powerful and effective features for pixel-level semantic segmentation, which are then combined hierarchically. Furthermore, rather than using fixed information propagation routes, we subdivide images into super-pixels, and use the spatial relationship between them in order to perform image-adapted context aggregation. Our extensive evaluation on public benchmarks indicates that all of the aforementioned components of our approach increase the effectiveness of information propagation throughout the network, and significantly improve its eventual segmentation accuracy.",

In particular, we use intersecting gazes to learn 3D locations that people tend to look at, which is analogous to having multiple camera views. The 3D locations that we discover need not be visible to the camera. Conversely, knowing 3D locations of scene elements that draw visual attention, such as other people in the scene, can help infer gaze direction. We provide a Bayesian generative model for the temporal scene that captures the joint probability of camera parameters, locations of people, their gaze, what they are looking at, and locations of visual attention. Both the number of people in the scene and the number of extra objects that draw attention are unknown and need to be inferred. To execute this joint inference we use a probabilistic data association approach that enables principled comparison of model hypotheses. We use MCMC for inference over the discrete correspondence variables, and approximate the marginalization over continuous parameters using the Metropolis-Laplace approximation, using Hamiltonian (Hybrid) Monte Carlo for maximization. As existing data sets do not provide the 3D locations of what people are looking at, we contribute a small data set that does.

		"title": "Macro-Micro Adversarial Network for Human Parsing",
		"abstract": "In human parsing, the pixel-wise classification loss has drawbacks in its low-level local inconsistency and high-level semantic inconsistency. The introduction of the adversarial network tackles the two problems using a single discriminator. However, the two types of parsing inconsistency are generated by distinct mechanisms, so it is difficult for a single discriminator to solve them both. To address the two kinds of inconsistencies, this paper proposes the Macro-Micro Adversarial Net (MMAN). It has two discriminators. One discriminator, Macro D, acts on the low-resolution label map and penalizes semantic inconsistency, e.g., misplaced body parts. The other discriminator, Micro D, focuses on multiple patches of the high-resolution label map to address the local inconsistency, e.g., blur and hole. Compared with traditional adversarial networks, MMAN not only enforces local and semantic consistency explicitly, but also avoids the poor convergence problem of adversarial networks when handling high resolution images. In our experiment, we validate that the two discriminators are complementary to each other in improving the human parsing accuracy. The proposed framework is capable of producing competitive parsing performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, i.e., mIoU=46.81% and 59.91% on LIP and PASCAL-Person-Part, respectively. On a relatively small dataset PPSS, our pre-trained model demonstrates impressive generalization ability.",

However, training such a deep model requires a large amount of manual annotations. Our goal is to overcome this limitation by automatically converting an existing deep contour detection model into a salient object detection model without using any manual salient object masks. For this purpose, we have created a deep network architecture, namely Contour-to-Saliency Network (C2S-Net), by grafting a new branch onto a well-trained contour detection network. Therefore, our C2S-Net has two branches for performing two different tasks: 1) predicting contours with the original contour branch, and 2) estimating per-pixel saliency score of each image with the newly-added saliency branch. To bridge the gap between these two tasks, we further propose a contour-to-saliency transferring method to automatically generate salient object masks which can be used to train the saliency branch from outputs of the contour branch. Finally, we introduce a novel alternating training pipeline to gradually update the network parameters. In this scheme, the contour branch generates saliency masks for training the saliency branch, while the saliency branch, in turn, feeds back saliency knowledge in the form of saliency-aware contour labels, for fine-tuning the contour branch. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five well-known benchmarks, outperforming existing fully supervised methods while also maintaining high efficiency.",

Datasets collected in this manner tend to generate high classication accuracy as search engines typically rank easy\" videos rst. The SOA dataset adopts a dierent approach. We rely on uniform sampling to get a better representations of videos on the Web. Trained annotators are asked to provide free-form text labels describing each video in three dierent aspects: scene, object and action. These raw labels are then merged, split and renamed to generate a taxonomy for SOA. All the annotations are veried again based on the taxonomy. The nal dataset includes 562K videos with 3.64M annotations spanning 49 categories for scenes, 356 for objects, and 148 for actions. We show that datasets collected in this way are quite challenging by evaluating existing popular video models on SOA.

We compare SOA with existing datasets in the context of transfer learning and demonstrate that pre-training on SOA consistently improves the accuracy on a wide variety of datasets.

Considering that the 360° videos are usually stored with equirectangular panorama, we propose to implement the spherical convolution on panorama by stretching and rotating the kernel based on the location of patch to be convolved. Compared with existing spherical convolution, our definition has the parameter sharing property, which would greatly reduce the parameters to be learned.

		"title": "DetNet: Design Backbone for Object Detection",
		"abstract": "Recent CNN based object detectors, either one-stage methods like YOLO, SSD, and RetinaNet, or two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN, R-FCN and FPN, are usually trying to directly finetune from ImageNet pre-trained models designed for the task of image classification. However, there has been little work discussing the backbone feature extractor specifically designed for the task of object detection. More importantly, there are several differences between the tasks of image classification and object detection. (1) Recent object detectors like FPN and RetinaNet usually involve extra stages against the task of image classification to handle the objects with various scales. (2) Object detection not only needs to recognize the category of the object instances but also spatially locate them. Large downsampling factors bring large valid receptive field, which is good for image classification but compromises the object location ability. Due to the gap between the image classification and object detection, we propose DetNet in this paper, which is a novel backbone network specifically designed for object detection. Moreover, DetNet includes the extra stages against traditional backbone network for image classification, while maintains high spatial resolution in deeper layers. Without any bells and whistles, state-of-the-art results have been obtained for both object detection and instance segmentation on the MSCOCO benchmark based on our DetNet~(4.8G FLOPs) backbone.

The facial dynamics interpreter network is designed to be able to encode a relational importance, which is used for interpreting the relation between facial local dynamics and estimating facial traits. By comparative experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated.

To tackle these challenges, we propose an end-to-end training network which accomplishes foreground predictions by leveraging the location-sensitive embeddings which are capable to distinguish the pixels of similar objects. To deal with appearance changes, for a test video, we propose a robust model adaptation method which pre-scans the whole video, generates pseudo foreground/background labels and retrains the model based on the labels.

The deep neural network models provide the stronger representation ability and faster reconstruction compared with \"shallow\" optimization-based methods. However, in the existing deep-based CS-MRI models, the high-level semantic supervision information from massive segmentation-labels in MRI dataset is overlooked. In this paper, we proposed a segmentation-aware deep fusion network called SADFN for compressed sensing MRI. The multilayer feature aggregation (MLFA) method is introduced here to fuse all the features from different layers in the segmentation network. Then, the aggregated feature maps containing semantic information are provided to each layer in the reconstruction network with a feature fusion strategy. This guarantees the reconstruction network is aware of the different regions in the image it reconstructs, simplifying the function mapping. We prove the utility of the cross-layer and cross-task information fusion strategy by comparative study. Extensive experiments on brain segmentation benchmark MRBrainS validated that the proposed SADFN model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in compressed sensing MRI.

To address this limitation, in this paper, we introduce a novel GAN conditioning scheme based on Action Units (AU) annotations, which describes in a continuous manifold the anatomical facial movements defining a human expression. Our approach allows controlling the magnitude of activation of each AU and combine several of them. Additionally, we propose a fully unsupervised strategy to train the model, that only requires images annotated with their activated AUs, and exploit attention mechanisms that make our network robust to changing backgrounds and lighting conditions.

By decomposing the neural activations of the input image into semantically interpretable components pre-trained from a large concept corpus, the proposed framework is able to disentangle the evidence encoded in the activation feature vector, and quantify the contribution of each piece of evidence to the final prediction. We apply our framework for providing explanations to several popular networks for visual recognition, and show it is able to explain the predictions given by the networks in human-interpretable way.

Our transfer scheme is based on the observation that the model parameters at the bottom layers of a deep convolutional neural network can be directly shared between RGB and depth data while the remaining layers need to be fine-tuned rapidly. Our second contribution enhances re-identification for video by implementing temporal attention as a Bernoulli-Sigmoid unit acting upon frame-level features. Since this unit is stochastic, the temporal attention parameters are trained using reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments validate the accuracy of our method in person re-identification from depth sequences. Finally, in a scenario where subjects wear unseen clothes, we show large performance gains compared to a state-of-the-art model which relies on RGB data.",

The optimization space of node motions and the range of physically-plausible deformations are largely reduced by taking advantage of the articulated motion prior, which is solved by an efficient node graph segmentation method.

This allows us to cope with the main limitation of random sampling in training a conventional triplet loss, which is a central issue for deep metric learning. Our main contributions are two-fold. (i) we construct a hierarchical class-level tree where neighboring classes are merged recursively. The hierarchical structure naturally captures the intrinsic data distribution over the whole dataset. (ii) we formulate the problem of triplet collection by introducing a new violate margin, which is computed dynamically based on the designed hierarchical tree. This allows it to automatically select meaningful hard samples with the guide of global context. It encourages the model to learn more discriminative features from visual similar classes, leading to faster convergence and better performance. In addition, the proposed HTL is easily implemented, and the new violate margin can be readily integrated into the standard triplet loss and other deep metric learning functions. Our method is evaluated on the tasks of image retrieval and face recognition, where it can obtain comparable performance with much fewer iterations. It outperforms the standard triplet loss substantially by 1% - 18%, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmarks.",

However, in challenging imaging conditions such as on low resolution images or when the image is corrupted by imaging artifacts, current systems degrade considerably in accuracy. While a loss in performance is unavoidable we would like our models to quantify their uncertainty in order to achieve robustness against images of varying quality. Probabilistic deep learning models combine the expressive power of deep learning with uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic deep learning model for the task of angular regression. Our model uses von Mises distributions to predict a distribution over object pose angle. Whereas a single von Mises distribution is making strong assumptions about the shape of the distribution, we extend the basic model to predict a mixture of von Mises distributions. We show how to learn a mixture model using a finite and infinite number of mixture components. Our model allow for likelihood-based training and efficient inference at test time. We demonstrate on a number of challenging pose estimation datasets that our model produces calibrated probability predictions and competitive or superior point estimates compared to the current state-of-the-art.",

In this paper, we present a method for scoring the individual correspondences by exploiting semantic information about the query image and the scene. In this way, erroneous correspondences tend to get a low semantic consistency score, whereas correct correspondences tend to get a high score.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a new decouple learning algorithm to learn from the operator parameters to dynamically adjust the weights of a deep network for image operators, denoted as the base network. The learned algorithm is formed as another network, namely the weight learning network, which can be end-to-end jointly trained with the base network.

However, Hamming space retrieval is ineffective in existing cross-modal hashing methods, subject to their weak capability of concentrating the relevant items to be within a small Hamming ball, while worse still, the Hamming distances between hash codes from different modalities are inevitably large due to the large heterogeneity across different modalities. This work presents Cross-Modal Hamming Hashing (CMHH), a novel deep cross-modal hashing approach that generates compact and highly concentrated hash codes to enable efficient and effective Hamming space retrieval.
